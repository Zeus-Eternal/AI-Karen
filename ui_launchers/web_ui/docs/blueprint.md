# **App Name**: Project Titan

## Core Features:

- Intelligent Assistant: Karen utilizes a Large Language Model to process user input. The LLM synthesizes available data, including short-term and long-term memories, and knowledge graph insights, before generating a response. It acts as a tool to incorporate context and emotional cues, emulating human-like associations.
- Short-Term Memory: A Redis-based key-value store caches information from the current user session, accelerating assistant responses and emulating the rapid recall of short-term human memory.
- Long-Term Memory: PostgreSQL with pgvector stores user conversations and assistant responses as vector embeddings, enabling semantic similarity searches and mimicking the long-term storage of human memories.
- Keyword Extraction: RAKE or TF-IDF extracts keywords from user prompts, aiding in the response generation and mirroring how humans identify essential concepts in communication.
- Semantic Similarity: Sentence Transformers with FAISS enables semantic similarity searches, allowing Karen to recall and associate information based on meaning and context.
- Knowledge Graph: A Neo4j knowledge graph stores and reasons over real-world information, enhancing Karen's contextual awareness and conversational abilities by representing relationships between concepts.
- Reinforcement Learning: TensorFlow or PyTorch implements reinforcement learning, enabling Karen to continuously adapt and improve her memory over time. This simulates the human brain's ability to learn from experience.
- Information Display: The UI displays received prompts, AI responses, extracted keywords, and knowledge graph insights in a clear and intuitive way. The system has headless capability and mobile extendability.
- Local AI Processing: Local first implementation, such as with llama-cpp-python, enabling the AI assistant to function locally without relying on external cloud services. This enhances privacy and reduces latency.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark charcoal (#333333) provides a sophisticated backdrop and reduces eye strain.
- Electric purple (#BE75FF) symbolizes intelligence and innovation for interactive elements.
- Soft lavender (#B9B0FF) highlights less critical interactive elements and options.
- Clean, modern sans-serif font ensures readability on screen.
- Minimalist icons facilitate clear, intuitive navigation.
- A clean layout features a prominent input field and scrolling output, similar to a chat application interface.
