# Database Consistency Integration Tests

This directory contains comprehensive integration tests for database consistency validation across PostgreSQL, Redis, and Milvus databases. These tests validate cross-database reference integrity, migration rollback scenarios, connection pool behavior under load, and cache invalidation patterns.

## Requirements Coverage

These tests fulfill the following requirements from the production readiness audit:

- **Requirement 2.1**: Database health validation and connectivity testing
- **Requirement 2.2**: Cross-database consistency validation between PostgreSQL, Redis, and Milvus
- **Requirement 2.3**: Connection pool behavior testing under various load conditions
- **Requirement 2.5**: Migration validation and rollback scenario testing

## Test Files

### 1. test_database_consistency_integration.py

**Purpose**: Tests cross-database reference integrity and consistency validation.

**Test Classes**:
- `TestCrossDatabaseReferenceIntegrity`: Tests PostgreSQL â†” Milvus reference integrity, Redis cache consistency, and orphaned record detection

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Cross-database reference integrity validation between PostgreSQL and Milvus
- Redis cache consistency validation with PostgreSQL data
- Detection of orphaned records across databases
- Handling of database failures during consistency validation

### 2. test_connection_pool_stress.py

**Purpose**: Tests database connection pool behavior under various stress conditions.

**Test Classes**:
- `TestConnectionPoolStress`: Comprehensive stress testing of database connection pools

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Connection pool behavior under sudden burst load (25+ concurrent requests)
- Sustained load testing with multiple concurrent workers over time
- Connection pool recovery after exhaustion scenarios
- Timeout handling under stress conditions with slow connections

### 3. test_cache_invalidation_patterns.py

**Purpose**: Tests various cache invalidation patterns and validation scenarios.

**Test Classes**:
- `TestCacheInvalidationPatterns`: Tests different cache invalidation strategies and patterns

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Write-through cache invalidation pattern testing
- Write-behind (write-back) cache invalidation pattern testing
- Cache-aside (lazy loading) invalidation pattern testing
- Bulk cache invalidation with pattern-based operations
- TTL-based cache invalidation and expiration testing
- Cache invalidation under race conditions and concurrent access
- Cache consistency validation between Redis and PostgreSQL

### 4. test_migration_rollback_scenarios.py

**Purpose**: Tests database migration rollback scenarios and validation.

**Test Classes**:
- `TestMigrationRollbackScenarios`: Tests various migration rollback and recovery scenarios

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Successful migration rollback validation
- Incomplete migration rollback detection and validation
- Migration rollback without proper version tracking
- Migration rollback with data corruption scenarios
- Migration rollback recovery process validation
- Foreign key constraint issues during rollback
- Performance testing with large datasets and many migrations

## Test Architecture

### Mocking Strategy

The tests use comprehensive mocking to simulate:
- Database managers (PostgreSQL, Redis, Milvus)
- Database sessions and connections
- Connection pool states and metrics
- Cache data and TTL management
- Migration states and schema information

### Async Testing

All tests are designed as async functions using `@pytest.mark.asyncio` to properly test the asynchronous database operations used throughout the system.

### Realistic Scenarios

Tests simulate realistic production scenarios including:
- High concurrent load (20+ simultaneous operations)
- Connection pool exhaustion and recovery
- Database failures and degraded modes
- Cache inconsistencies and stale data
- Migration rollbacks with partial failures

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
```

### Running Individual Test Files

```bash
# Cross-database reference integrity tests
pytest tests/integration/database/test_database_consistency_integration.py -v

# Connection pool stress tests
pytest tests/integration/database/test_connection_pool_stress.py -v

# Cache invalidation pattern tests
pytest tests/integration/database/test_cache_invalidation_patterns.py -v

# Migration rollback scenario tests
pytest tests/integration/database/test_migration_rollback_scenarios.py -v
```

### Running All Database Integration Tests

```bash
pytest tests/integration/database/ -v
```

### Validation Without pytest

If pytest is not available, you can validate test structure and coverage:

```bash
python3 tests/integration/database/validate_tests.py
```

## Test Coverage Summary

- **Total Test Files**: 4
- **Total Test Methods**: 32
- **Cross-Database Scenarios**: 14 test methods
- **Connection Pool Scenarios**: 4 test methods  
- **Cache Invalidation Scenarios**: 7 test methods
- **Migration Rollback Scenarios**: 7 test methods

## Integration with Production Services

These tests integrate with the following production services:

- `DatabaseConsistencyValidator`: Cross-database validation service
- `DatabaseHealthChecker`: Database health monitoring service
- `MigrationValidator`: Migration status validation service
- `DatabaseConnectionManager`: PostgreSQL connection management
- `RedisConnectionManager`: Redis connection management
- `MilvusClient`: Milvus vector database client

## Performance Considerations

The tests are designed to:
- Complete within reasonable time limits (< 5 seconds per test)
- Handle concurrent operations efficiently
- Simulate realistic load patterns
- Test timeout and recovery scenarios
- Validate performance under stress conditions

## Error Handling

Tests validate proper error handling for:
- Database connection failures
- Pool exhaustion scenarios
- Cache inconsistencies
- Migration rollback failures
- Timeout conditions
- Data corruption scenarios

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for test expansion:
- Multi-tenant database consistency testing
- Cross-region database replication testing
- Advanced cache warming strategies
- Complex migration dependency scenarios
- Real-time consistency monitoring integration
