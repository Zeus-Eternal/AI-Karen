## Dependencies

The comprehensive tests require:

- `pytest` - Test framework
- `pytest-asyncio` - Async test support
- `pytest-html` - HTML report generation
- `psutil` - System resource monitoring
- `torch` - GPU/CUDA testing (optional)
- `statistics` - Performance analysis

Install test dependencies:
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-html psutil torch
```

## CI/CD Integration

The tests are designed for CI/CD integration:

- Generate JUnit XML reports for test result parsing
- Support quiet mode for automated environments
- Provide clear exit codes (0 = success, non-zero = failure)
- Skip GPU tests when hardware is not available
- Generate machine-readable JSON reports

Example CI/CD usage:
```yaml
- name: Run Comprehensive Validation
  run: |
    python run_comprehensive_validation.py --quiet
    
- name: Upload Test Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-reports
    path: tests/comprehensive/results/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure the `src` directory is in Python path
2. **GPU Tests Failing**: Install PyTorch with CUDA support or skip GPU tests
3. **Permission Errors**: Ensure write permissions for `tests/comprehensive/results/`
4. **Memory Issues**: Reduce concurrent test execution or increase system memory

### Debug Mode

Run tests with verbose output and debugging:
```bash
pytest tests/comprehensive/ -v -s --tb=long --showlocals
```

### Skip Specific Tests

Skip tests that require specific hardware:
```bash
# Skip GPU tests
pytest tests/comprehensive/ -m "not gpu"

# Skip slow tests
pytest tests/comprehensive/ -m "not slow"
```
