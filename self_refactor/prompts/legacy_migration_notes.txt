Kari UI — Legacy Migration Notes
================================

Overview:
---------
This file tracks all pending, active, and completed migrations from legacy panels/components/pages to the modern Kari UI architecture. Use this as the authoritative migration backlog and as a “change-of-record” doc for technical debt, rollbacks, and sunset logic.

Instructions:
-------------
- For **each legacy feature**: document location, migration status, responsible owner, and replacement path.
- For **every removal**: note any feature flags, rollback instructions, and last release containing the legacy component.
- Update this file on every merge/PR that touches legacy UI or API endpoints.

Schema (copy/paste for each entry):
-----------------------------------

Feature/Panel:        [Name/short desc]
Legacy Location:      [/absolute/path/to/old]
New Location:         [/absolute/path/to/new]
Migration Status:     [Pending | In Progress | Complete | Deprecated | Flagged]
Owner:                [Name/Git handle]
Feature Flag:         [yes/no; if yes, name it: e.g. "enable_legacy_admin"]
Last Legacy Release:  [e.g. v0.4.1]
Notes/Rollback:       [How to re-enable, critical dependencies, special testing notes]

Example:
--------

Legacy Location:      /admin_ui/pages/dashboard.py
New Location:         /ui_logic/pages/admin.py

Owner:                @devops-evil
Feature Flag:         yes ("enable_legacy_admin")
Last Legacy Release:  v0.4.1
Notes/Rollback:       Rollback by toggling feature flag; ensure Prometheus metrics still route to new admin.
