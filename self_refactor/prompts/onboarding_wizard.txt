Kari Onboarding Wizard — Spec & Requirements
============================================

Purpose:
--------
Defines the canonical, multi-step onboarding experience for all new Kari users,  
including role assignment, preference capture, consent flows, and memory/profile setup.

UX Requirements:
----------------
- Multi-step, stateful wizard (login/register ➔ profile ➔ consent ➔ finish)
- Steps:
    1. **Identity**: Login/Register, assign user_id (uses /ui_logic/hooks/auth.py)
    2. **Profile**: Capture name, preferred pronouns, persona/voice (uses /ui_logic/components/memory/profile_panel.py)
    3. **Consent**: Memory policy, privacy, EchoCore opt-in/out, analytics
    4. **Feature Discovery**: Quick tour of main UI features, plugins, chat, etc.
    5. **Finish**: Success, route to main app/dashboard
- **RBAC**: Public for Step 1, `user` required for all subsequent steps
- **Config**: All onboarding UX should pull options/text from `/ui_logic/config/ui_config.py`
- **Telemetry**: All onboarding actions/events must be logged (use `/ui_logic/hooks/telemetry.py`)
- **Extensible**: New steps/features may be added via plugin manifest

Acceptance Criteria:
--------------------
- A brand-new user is guided through all steps; session persists across reloads.
- Completion of onboarding is audit-logged.
- Users can review/edit their profile later in memory/profile_panel.py.

Dev Notes:
----------
- All onboarding logic must be reusable in both Tauri/React and web UIs.
- For major onboarding changes, update this doc and attach sample UX flows.
- See also: `nav_tree_map.txt` for page/modal integration.
