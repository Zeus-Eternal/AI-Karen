Kari UI Accessibility Audit — Living Report
===========================================

Purpose:
--------
Audit all Kari UI views and components for accessibility (A11y) compliance:  
WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA, ARIA tags, keyboard navigation, high-contrast support, screen reader compatibility.

Audit Checklist:
----------------
- [ ] Keyboard navigability (tab order, focus rings, shortcut keys)
- [ ] ARIA roles/labels for all widgets/inputs
- [ ] High-contrast theme toggle (with `/ui_logic/themes/`)
- [ ] Text resizing and responsive layout
- [ ] Screen reader test (NVDA/VoiceOver/JAWS)
- [ ] Alt-text on all icons/images/avatars
- [ ] Error/validation states: descriptive, not color-only
- [ ] Form labels/inputs: associated, unique IDs
- [ ] Modal dialogs: focus trap, escape closes
- [ ] Live region updates for dynamic content (e.g., chat, plugin output)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop: accessible fallback

Audit Log:
----------
2025-07-03 — Initial Audit:  
• Home, Chat, Settings: pass most keyboard and ARIA checks  
• Plugin panels: require unique ARIA labels  
• Persona/emotion pickers: need descriptive alt/text  
• Modal dialogs: focus management to be improved  
• High-contrast: available, not default; recommend user toggle in all flows

Remediation Plan:
-----------------
- [ ] Update plugin UI template to include `aria-label` and tabIndex
- [ ] Add screen-reader-only error summary on forms
- [ ] Enforce alt-text upload in Branding Center
- [ ] Extend `theme_manager.py` with user font-size override
