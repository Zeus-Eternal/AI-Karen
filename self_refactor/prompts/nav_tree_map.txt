Kari UI Navigation Tree â€” Source of Truth
=========================================

Purpose:
--------
Defines the canonical sidebar/topbar/modal navigation layout for all Kari UIs (Tauri, Streamlit, Mobile, etc).  
ALL new features/pages MUST be registered here and grouped by user role and context.

Format:
-------
- Use markdown-style bullets to denote nesting.
- Include role badges: [user], [dev], [admin], [enterprise], [public]
- For modals or dynamic panes, prefix with (modal).
- For feature-flagged panels, append [flag:NAME].

Example (update as UI grows):
-----------------------------

- Home [user, public]
- Chat [user, dev, admin]
    - Persona Controls [user]
    - Multimodal Upload [flag:enable_multimodal_chat]
