        --------------------------------
        
        2.1. Grants
        
        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
        non-exclusive license:
        
        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

        (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
            for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.
        
        2.2. Effective Date
        
        The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
        become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
        distributes such Contribution.
        
        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
        
        The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
        Contributor:
        
        (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
            or
        
        (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or
        
        (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.
        
        This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
        or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
        the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
        
        2.4. Subsequent Licenses
        
        No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
        distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
        permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
        
        2.5. Representation
        
        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
        to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
        
        2.6. Fair Use
        
        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
        applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
        equivalents.
        
        2.7. Conditions
        
        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
        in Section 2.1.
        
        3. Responsibilities
        -------------------
        
        3.1. Distribution of Source Form
        
        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
        Form.
        
        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
        
        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
        
        (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
        
        (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
        
        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
        
        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
        License(s).
        
        3.4. Notices
        
        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
        or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
        the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
        the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
        
        3.5. Application of Additional Terms
        
        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
        jurisdiction.
        
        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
        the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
        describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
        be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
        Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
        or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
        
        5. Termination
        --------------
        
        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
        if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
        compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
        Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
        ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
        non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
        come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
        notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
        first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
        from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
        Your receipt of the notice.
        
        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
        counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
        2.1 of this License shall terminate.
        
        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
        have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
        prior to termination shall survive termination.

        8. Litigation
        -------------
        
        Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
        courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
        place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
        Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
        cross-claims or counter-claims.
        
        9. Miscellaneous
        ----------------
        
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
        that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
        shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
        
        10. Versions of the License

        steward.
        
        10.3. Modified Versions
        
        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
        such modified license differs from this License).
        
        10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
        Licenses
        
        If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

### Key Components

#### Main Application (`page.tsx`)
- **SidebarProvider**: Layout management with collapsible sidebar
- **Navigation**: Dynamic view switching between chat, settings, and plugins
- **Plugin Integration**: Dedicated interfaces for each plugin type
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

#### UI Components (`components/ui/`)
All UI components are built on Radix UI primitives with custom styling:
- Fully accessible with keyboard navigation
- Consistent design system with CSS custom properties
- Dark mode support built-in
- TypeScript interfaces for all props

#### Chat Interface (`components/chat/`)
- Real-time message handling
- Message history and context management
- AI response processing and display
- Voice synthesis integration (TTS)

#### Backend Integration (`lib/karen-backend.ts`)
- RESTful API client for AI-Karen backend
- Memory service integration
- Plugin execution management
- Analytics and system metrics
- Caching layer for performance optimization

## API Integration

### Backend Service Integration

The web UI integrates with the AI-Karen backend through a comprehensive service layer:

#### Chat Processing
```typescript
// Process user messages with full context
const response = await karenBackend.processUserMessage(
  message,
  conversationHistory,
  settings,
  userId,
  sessionId
);
```

#### Memory Management
```typescript
// Store conversation in long-term memory
await karenBackend.storeMemory(
  content,
  metadata,
  tags,
  userId,
  sessionId
);

// Query relevant memories
const memories = await karenBackend.queryMemories({
  text: query,
  user_id: userId,
  top_k: 5
});
```

#### Plugin Execution
```typescript
// Execute plugins with parameters
const result = await karenBackend.executePlugin(
  'database-connector',
  { query: 'SELECT * FROM users' },
  userId
);
```

### Error Handling

- **Network Resilience**: Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Fallback Responses**: Graceful degradation when backend is unavailable
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery suggestions
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with comprehensive type checking
- **ESLint**: Configured for React and Next.js best practices
- **Component Structure**: Functional components with hooks
- **File Naming**: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components

### State Management
- **Local State**: React useState for component-specific state
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API data management
- **Form State**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Global State**: Context API for application-wide state

### Performance Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic with Next.js App Router
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with optimization
- **Bundle Analysis**: Built-in bundle analyzer
- **Caching**: Service worker caching for offline functionality

## Building and Deployment

### Development Build
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Runs on port 9002
- Hot module replacement enabled
- Turbopack for faster builds
- Source maps for debugging

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
- Runs on port 3000
- Optimized bundle with tree shaking
- Static generation where possible
- Compressed assets
- Performance monitoring

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backend Connection Issues
```bash
# Check backend status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Verify environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL

# Wait for the API to become reachable
../scripts/wait-for-kari-api.sh

# Smoke-test conversation creation
../scripts/smoke-create-conversation.sh
```

If requests continue to fail, ensure the backend allows your UI origin via
`KARI_CORS_ORIGINS` and include an `X-Tenant-ID` header when calling
non-public routes.

#### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Type check
npm run typecheck
```

#### Development Server Issues
```bash
# Check port availability
lsof -i :9002

# Start with different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Performance Issues
- **Large Bundle Size**: Use bundle analyzer to identify large dependencies
- **Slow API Responses**: Check backend performance and network latency
- **Memory Leaks**: Use React DevTools Profiler to identify issues

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+
- **Feature Detection**: Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features
