        2. License Grants and Conditions
        --------------------------------
        
        2.1. Grants
        
        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
        non-exclusive license:
        
        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
            Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
            as part of a Larger Work; and
        
        (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
            for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.
        
        2.2. Effective Date
        
        The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
        become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
        distributes such Contribution.
        
        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
        
        The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
        Contributor:
        
        (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
            or
        
        (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or
        
        (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.
        
        This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
        or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
        the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
        
        2.4. Subsequent Licenses
        
        No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
        distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
        permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
        
        2.5. Representation
        
        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
        to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
        
        2.6. Fair Use
        
        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
        applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
        equivalents.
        
        2.7. Conditions
        
        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
        in Section 2.1.
        
        3. Responsibilities
        -------------------
        
        3.1. Distribution of Source Form
        
        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
        Form.
        
        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
        
        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
        
        (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
        
        (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
        
        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
        
        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
        License(s).
        
        3.4. Notices
        
        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
        or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
        the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
        the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
        
        3.5. Application of Additional Terms
        
        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
        jurisdiction.
        
        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
        the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
        describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
        be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
        Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
        or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
        
        5. Termination
        --------------
        
        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
        if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
        compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
        Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
        ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
        non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
        come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
        notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
        first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
        from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
        Your receipt of the notice.
        
        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
        counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
        2.1 of this License shall terminate.
        
        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
        have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
        prior to termination shall survive termination.

        8. Litigation
        -------------
        
        Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
        courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
        place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
        Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
        cross-claims or counter-claims.
        
        9. Miscellaneous
        ----------------
        
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
        that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
        shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
        
        10. Versions of the License
        ---------------------------
        
        10.1. New Versions
        
        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
        10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
        publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.
        
        10.2. Effect of New Versions
        
        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
        of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
        or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
        steward.
        
        10.3. Modified Versions
        
        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
        such modified license differs from this License).
        
        10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
        Licenses
        
        If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
        Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
        notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

# AI-Karen: Production AI Platform
[![CI](https://github.com/OWNER/AI-Karen/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OWNER/AI-Karen/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> **Enterprise-ready AI platform with modular architecture, multi-database support, and comprehensive UI ecosystem.**
> AI-Karen provides a production-grade FastAPI backend with multiple frontend interfaces, extensive plugin system, and robust data infrastructure for scalable AI applications.

AI-Karen is a comprehensive, production-ready AI platform designed for enterprise deployments. The system features a modular architecture with FastAPI backend, multiple UI interfaces, extensive plugin ecosystem, and robust multi-database infrastructure optimized for AI workloads.

### LLM Runtime: In‑Process by Default

This project defaults to the in‑process llama‑cpp‑python runtime for local GGUF models. The legacy external Llama.cpp server manager (`serverKent/`) has been removed to simplify operations and reduce latency.

- Place GGUF models under `models/llama-cpp/` (e.g., `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf`).
- Default settings point to this model; adjust `llm_settings.json` if needed.
- No HTTP llama server is required — the API performs inference directly.

Optional: If you must run an external `llama-server`, do it outside this repo and point a custom provider to it; in-repo support is intentionally not maintained.

### Startup Warmup

On boot, the backend preloads the default llama‑cpp model (best‑effort) to avoid first‑request latency. Control via `WARMUP_LLM` env (`true` by default).

### Performance Profile (OpenBLAS)

For CPU speedups, a “perf” image variant enables OpenBLAS for llama‑cpp:

- Build: `PROFILE=runtime-perf docker compose build api` (or set `PROFILE=runtime-perf` in your environment).
- Default remains `runtime` (portable, no BLAS). Both variants support in‑process inference.

Tuning env:

- `LLAMA_THREADS`: override CPU threads (default: `os.cpu_count()`).
- `LLAMA_MLOCK`: set `true` to lock model in RAM (requires sufficient memory).
- `n_gpu_layers` in `llm_settings.json`: offload layers to GPU when configured.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/AI-Karen.git
cd AI-Karen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch Services

```bash
# start databases and supporting services
docker compose up -d

# initialize core tables and default admin user
python create_tables.py
python create_admin_user.py  # follow prompts

# start the FastAPI backend
python main.py
```

The web UI is available at <http://localhost:9002> and the API at <http://localhost:8000>.

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Database Setup

AI-Karen ships with multiple data stores. The default `docker-compose.yml`
spins up the full stack with sensible development defaults:

| Service | Purpose | Port |
|---------|---------|------|
| PostgreSQL | metadata storage | 5433 |
| Redis | caching and sessions | 6379 |
| Milvus | vector similarity search | 19530 |
| Elasticsearch | full-text search | 9200 |
| DuckDB | local analytics | n/a |

Custom connection strings can be supplied via environment variables defined in `config/`.

## Example Usage

Query the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/summary
```

Create a chat completion using the Python client:

```python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/completions",
    json={"input": "Hello, AI-Karen"},
)
print(resp.json())
```

---

## Authentication Configuration

The authentication service relies on the `AuthConfig` class for all
runtime settings. Configuration can be provided in environment-specific
YAML or JSON files:

```python
from ai_karen_engine.auth.config import AuthConfig

# Load from a specific file and environment
config = AuthConfig.from_file("config/auth_config.yaml", "development")

# Or discover the file in the default ``config/`` directory
config = AuthConfig.from_environment("production")
```

Example configuration files are provided in `config/auth_config.yaml`
and `config/auth_config.json`.

### Production Authentication Setup

AI-Karen ships with a production-ready authentication stack featuring
PostgreSQL storage, bcrypt password hashing, JWT token management,
Redis-backed sessions, and multi-tenant support. See
[Production Authentication Setup](docs/auth/PRODUCTION_AUTH_SETUP.md) for
full deployment instructions.

**Environment Variables**

```bash
cp config/production_auth_config.env .env
# Edit .env with secure production values
```

**Migration Script**

Initialize the authentication database schema:

```bash
python scripts/run_auth_migration.py
# Optional dry run
python scripts/run_auth_migration.py --dry-run
```

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Modular Design** - Loosely coupled components with clear interfaces
2. **Horizontal Scalability** - Database services can be scaled independently
3. **Plugin Architecture** - Hot-reloadable plugins with manifest-based configuration
4. **Multi-UI Support** - Different interfaces for different use cases
5. **Production Ready** - Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and health checks

## Development Setup

### Local Development Environment

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Set environment variables
export POSTGRES_USER=karen_user
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=karen_secure_pass_change_me
export POSTGRES_DB=ai_karen
export POSTGRES_HOST=postgres  # use 'postgres' when running via Docker
export POSTGRES_PORT=5433  # change if port 5432 is busy
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
export ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200
export MILVUS_HOST=localhost
export MILVUS_PORT=19530
```

### Development Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Format code | `black .` |
| Type checking | `mypy .` |
| Linting | `ruff check .` |
| Run tests | `pytest` |
| Start API | `uvicorn main:create_app --factory --reload` |
| Build web UI | `cd ui_launchers/KAREN-Theme-Default && npm run build` |
| Build desktop | `cd ui_launchers/desktop_ui && npm run tauri build` |

### Test Environment Setup

The test suite depends on several third-party libraries, including
`httpx`, `sqlalchemy`, `asyncpg`, `aiohttp`, `psutil`,
`prometheus_client`, and `bcrypt`. Install all test dependencies
before running `pytest`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Demo Scripts

When running the example demo scripts directly from the repository, set
`PYTHONPATH=src` so the `ai_karen_engine` package can be imported without
modifying `sys.path` inside the scripts:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python demo_plugin_system.py
```

### Plugin Development

Create a new plugin in `src/ai_karen_engine/plugins/`:

```bash
mkdir src/ai_karen_engine/plugins/my_plugin
```

**plugin_manifest.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "my_plugin",
  "description": "My custom plugin",
  "plugin_api_version": "0.1.0",
  "required_roles": ["user"],
  "intent": ["my_intent"]
}
```

**handler.py:**
```python
def run(message, context):
    return {
        "intent": "my_intent",
        "confidence": 1.0,
        "response": f"Hello from my_plugin! Message: {message}"
    }
```

Plugins are automatically discovered and hot-reloaded.

---

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Production deployment
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# With custom environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values
docker compose --env-file .env up -d
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
# Using Helm chart
helm install ai-karen ./charts/kari/ \

## API Reference

### Core Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | System health check |
| `GET` | `/ready` | Readiness probe |
| `GET` | `/metrics` | Application metrics |
| `GET` | `/metrics/prometheus` | Prometheus metrics |
| `POST` | `/chat` | Chat completion |
| `POST` | `/store` | Store memory |
| `POST` | `/search` | Search memories |
| `GET` | `/plugins` | List plugins |
| `GET` | `/models` | List AI models |

The memory query endpoint (`/api/memory/query`) returns at most **100 results** by default.
You can override this cap by providing the `result_limit` parameter in your request.

### Tenant Header

Most API endpoints are tenant-aware. Include an `X-Tenant-ID` header with your
tenant name in requests that are not listed under the public paths. For local
testing you can use `default`:

```bash
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: default" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "hello"}' http://localhost:8000/chat
```

### Authentication

```bash
# Login with default admin credentials
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@kari.ai", "password": "password123"}'

# Use token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:8000/chat

# Update your credentials after logging in
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/update_credentials \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"new_password": "strongpass"}'
```

### Plugin Management

```bash
# List plugins
curl http://localhost:8000/plugins

# Enable plugin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/plugins/my_plugin/enable

# Reload plugins
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/plugins/reload
```

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks

```bash
# Verify backend is listening on port 8000
ss -ltnp | grep :8000 || lsof -iTCP:8000 -sTCP:LISTEN

# System health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# API health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Detailed health summary
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/summary

# Metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics

# Service-specific health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/services/postgres/health
```

### Metrics

The system exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics/prometheus`:

* HTTP request metrics
* Database connection metrics
* Plugin execution metrics
* Memory usage metrics
* AI model performance metrics

### Logging

Structured logging with configurable levels. The server runs at `INFO` level by
default and prints `Greetings, the logs are ready for review` once startup
completes.

```bash
# Increase verbosity if needed
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# View logs
docker compose logs -f api
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Issues

**Problem**: `Connection refused` errors for databases

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# Restart services
docker compose restart postgres redis

# Check logs
docker compose logs postgres
```

#### Plugin Loading Failures

python -c "import json; print(json.load(open('src/ai_karen_engine/plugins/my_plugin/plugin_manifest.json')))"

# Reload plugins
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/plugins/reload

# Check plugin logs
docker compose logs api | grep plugin
```

#### Memory Issues

**Problem**: High memory usage or OOM errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check memory usage
docker stats

# Adjust memory limits in docker-compose.yml
# Restart with memory limits
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

#### Frontend Build Issues

**Problem**: UI build failures

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear node modules
cd ui_launchers/KAREN-Theme-Default
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+
```
