The duodenum also produces the hormone secretin to stimulate the pancreatic secretion of large amounts of sodium bicarbonate , which then raises pH of the chyme to 7 . The chyme then enters the jejunum , where the useful portion of it is transformed into chyle . ( As the material moves through the jejunum and ileum , digestion progresses , and the nonuseful portion will continue onward into the large intestine . ) The duodenum is protected by a thick layer of mucus and the neutralizing actions of the sodium bicarbonate and bile .<|answer_split|>pyloric valve<|answer_split|>the pyloric valve", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "in most plants phototropism is thought to occur because", "ground_truth": "Phototropism is the growth of an organism which responds to a light stimulus . It is most often observed in plants , but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi . The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs . This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light . Phototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli . Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism , while growth away from light is called negative phototropism ( skototropism ) . Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism , and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth . Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism , although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth . Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism , which allows them to grow towards dark , solid objects and climb them . The combination of phototropism and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction .", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "how does the mantle plume model explain the existence of hot spots", "ground_truth": "Plumes are postulated to rise through the mantle and begin to partially melt on reaching shallow depths in the asthenosphere by decompression melting . This would create large volumes of magma . The plume hypothesis postulates that this melt rises to the surface and erupts to form `` hot spots '' .<|answer_split|>A mantle plume is an upwelling of abnormally hot rock within the Earth 's mantle , first proposed by J. Tuzo Wilson in 1963 . As the heads of mantle plumes can partly melt when they reach shallow depths , they are often invoked as the cause of volcanic hotspots , such as Hawaii or Iceland , and flood basalts such as the Deccan and Siberian traps . Some such volcanic regions lie far from tectonic plate boundaries , while others represent unusually large - volume volcanism near plate boundaries or in large igneous provinces .<|answer_split|>A mantle plume is posited to exist where hot rock nucleates at the core - mantle boundary and rises through the Earth 's mantle becoming a diapir in the Earth 's crust . The currently active volcanic centers are known as hotspots . In particular , the concept that mantle plumes are fixed relative to one another , and anchored at the core - mantle boundary , would provide a natural explanation for the time - progressive chains of older volcanoes seen extending out from some such hot spots , such as the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain .", "data_source": "nq"}

Title End Card Original airdate 01 `` As If I Met Her in My Dream ... '' `` Yume no Naka de Atta , Yō na ... '' ( 夢 の 中 で 会っ た 、 よう な ... ) Hanokage January 7 , 2011 After having a strange dream , Madoka Kaname is surprised to find the girl from her dream , Homura Akemi , enroll into her school the next day . Seemingly knowing her already , Homura warns Madoka to stay the way she is , lest she risk losing everything . Later that day , when Madoka goes shopping with her friend , Sayaka Miki , Madoka hears a strange voice , leading her to a backroom area . There , she encounters a strange creature named Kyubey being attacked by Homura , who is revealed to be a magical girl . As Homura demands Madoka stay away from Kyubey , Sayaka arrives and escapes with Madoka , only for them to be caught in a mystical barrier and approached by strange monsters . They are rescued by another magical girl named Mami Tomoe , who dispels the attackers using her magic abilities . Homura then appears again and is confronted by Mami who tells her that she will overlook the attack on Kyubey as she does not wish to fight in front of the other girls . Homura then promptly leaves . Kyubey is healed by Mami 's powers and then explains that he wishes to form a contract with Madoka and Sayaka to make them magical girls . 02 `` That Would Be Truly Wonderful '' `` Sore wa Tottemo Ureshii Natte '' ( それは とっても 嬉しい なっ て ) Hekiru Hikawa January 14 , 2011 Mami and Kyubey explain to Madoka and Sayaka that Kyubey has the power to grant wishes , but in exchange , those who make wishes must become magical girls to fight witches , who are born from curses . Mami offers to take Madoka and Sayaka with her on a witch hunt to help each decide if there were a wish they would risk their lives for . The next day , Kyubey , who can not be seen by normal people , accompanies Madoka and Sayaka to school , where they learn to communicate with each other telepathically . Homura visits Madoka once again to repeat her warning , and refuses to answer when Madoka asks what her wish was . After school , Madoka , Sayaka and Mami follow the aura of the witch from the previous day to an abandoned building , where they manage to save a woman controlled by a witch from committing suicide . They then enter a portal inside the building where Mami finds and defeats the witch responsible , earning a Grief Seed which can be used to recover magical power . 03 `` I 'm Not Afraid of Anything Anymore '' `` Mō Nani mo Kowakunai '' ( もう 何 も 怖く ない ) Santa Tsuji January 21 , 2011 Sayaka visits an injured boy named Kyōsuke Kamijō , who was a violin player she admired when she was little . After defeating a witch 's familiar , Mami tells Madoka and Sayaka that she had been involved in a traffic accident and did not have time to think about her wish . She also lets Sayaka know about the precedents for wishing on behalf of other people . Later that night , as Madoka helps her mother and talks with her father , Mami is approached by Homura , who warns her about making Madoka a magical girl . The next day while visiting the hospital , Madoka and Sayaka find a Grief Seed that is close to activating , so Sayaka and Kyubey enter the portal ahead of them while Madoka finds Mami . As Madoka and Mami catch up with them , Homura tries to warn Mami about the witch , but Mami binds her to stop her from following them . As they continue , Madoka mentions her wish is to simply be a magical girl and help others . Mami laments that her job as a magical girl has left her lonely and afraid , but feels happy that Madoka wishes to fight alongside her . As the Grief Seed activates , Mami goes into action and starts to fight against the witch . However , the witch suddenly transforms into a huge caterpillar which decapitates and instantly kills Mami right before Madoka 's eyes . Homura , her bonds dissolving with Mami 's demise , steps in and defeats the witch , claiming the Grief Seed , leaving behind a mortified Madoka and a heavily resentful Sayaka . 04 `` Miracles and Magic Are Real '' `` Kiseki mo , Mahō mo , Arun da yo '' ( 奇跡 も 、 魔法 も 、 ある ん だ よ ) Jin Kobayashi January 28 , 2011 As Sayaka continues to be concerned about Kyōsuke , Madoka , still in despair over the death of Mami , admits she is too scared to become a magical girl , so Kyubey decides to let her be . Madoka is approached by Homura , who tells her that Mami , along with other magical girls she has seen die during her time , will only be considered missing by normal people . Madoka says she will never forget Mami or the fact that Homura saved her life , though Homura warns her that her kindness may turn against her . As Kyōsuke becomes more frustrated and desperate about his condition , which keeps him from being able to use his fingers to play the violin , Sayaka decides to contract with Kyubey . Out in the city , Madoka notices several people , including her classmate Hitomi Shizuki , infected by the witch 's kiss and preparing to kill themselves by mixing cleaning agents . When Madoka thwarts their attempted suicide , they chase her to a closet where she is caught by a witch who tortures her with memories of Mami 's death . Just then , she is rescued by Sayaka , who had become a magical girl after using her wish to cure Kyōsuke 's hand , much to the shock of Homura . Elsewhere , Kyubey greets another magical girl named Kyōko Sakura , who just came to the city , unhappy that Sayaka took over the area Mami once looked after . 05 `` There 's No Way I 'll Ever Regret It '' `` Kōkai nante , Aru Wakenai '' ( 後悔 なんて 、 ある わけ ない ) Yupon February 4 , 2011 Both Madoka and Homura show concern about Sayaka 's decision to become a magical girl . Sayaka visits Kyōsuke and feels happy that he is finally able to play his violin once again . Madoka asks Homura to become friends with Sayaka , not wanting her to suffer the same fate as Mami , though Homura 's words , that those who become magical girls can not be saved , do nothing to comfort her . Later that day , Madoka joins Sayaka on patrol , where they find a witch 's familiar , but it escapes when Sayaka 's attacks are blocked by Kyōko , who only cares about collecting Grief Seeds from mature witches . Kyōko 's selfishness angers Sayaka , and the two magical girls clash violently , with Madoka unable to do anything to stop them . As Kyōko gets the upper hand , Madoka considers using her wish to stop the fighting , but Homura steps in before she can do so . 06 `` This Just Ca n't Be Right '' `` Konna no Zettai Okashii yo '' ( こんな の 絶対 おかしい よ ) Hajime Ueda February 11 , 2011 Homura knocks Sayaka unconscious and gets Kyōko to leave , before reiterating to Madoka that she should not get involved , even telling her to give up on Sayaka . Kyubey mentions to Sayaka about the potential Madoka has to become a magical girl , but Sayaka insists that she does n't want Madoka to get involved . Homura confronts Kyōko , mentioning that something known as Walpurgisnacht is approaching in two weeks , to which Kyōko agrees to form an alliance with her to fight against it . Madoka becomes concerned about Sayaka , who ignores her pleas to try talking with Kyōko , also showing hatred towards Homura , whom she blames for Mami 's death . The next evening , Sayaka is once again confronted by Kyōko who goads her into another fight on top of a highway bridge . Before the battle can begin , Madoka arrives and throws Sayaka 's Soul Gem , the source of her magic energy , off the bridge in the hope of stopping the fight . However , this causes Sayaka to suddenly become lifeless , shocking both Madoka and Kyōko . Kyubey reveals that as part of the contract , the Soul Gem literally contains a magical girl 's soul , while their body is merely a shell that can only be controlled within 100 metres of the Soul Gem . Homura rushes to retrieve the Soul Gem and brings it back to Sayaka , reviving her . 07 `` Can You Face Your True Feelings ? '' `` Hontō no Kimochi to Mukiaemasu ka ? '' ( 本当 の 気持ち と 向き合え ます か ? ) Takashi Tensugi February 18 , 2011 Sayaka gets angry at Kyubey for keeping the truth from her , but he keeps her in check by making her feel the pain she would have otherwise felt while fighting Kyōko . The next day , Madoka asks Homura about the meaning behind Kyubey 's actions and why she never told them . Kyōko talks with Sayaka , taking her to a church which belonged to her father before he was excommunicated for his controversial beliefs . She explains how she made a contract with Kyubey so that people would listen to her father 's sermons , but when he found out about her wish , he broke down and killed himself and his family , leaving Kyōko alone . Sayaka apologizes to Kyōko but refuses to listen to her advice to live for herself . The next day , Kyōsuke returns to school , but Sayaka avoids talking to him . Hitomi confronts her about it and reveals she is also in love with Kyōsuke , giving Sayaka one day to confess to him before she does . Sayaka breaks down in front of Madoka , believing that she can never be with Kyōsuke as she feels she is no longer human . As Sayaka fights against a witch that night , she ignores Kyōko 's help and recklessly attacks the witch without regard to the damage caused to her body , laughing maniacally . 08 `` I Was Stupid , So Stupid '' `` Atashitte , Honto Baka '' ( あたし っ て 、 ほんと バカ ) Takuya Fujima February 25 , 2011 Sayaka defeats the witch , but refuses to take the Grief Seed it produces . Madoka tries to reason with Sayaka , who just berates her , blaming her for her state before running off . As Homura and Kyōko discuss Walpurgisnacht , Kyubey approaches them , mentioning that something bad will happen if Sayaka 's Soul Gem is not cleansed . Sayaka does not return home that night and just watches as Hitomi makes her confession to Kyōsuke the next day , sending her further into despair . Homura approaches her in an attempt to offer a Grief Seed , but Sayaka once again rejects it as she does not trust her . To spare Madoka the suffering of watching Sayaka 's downfall , Homura prepares to kill her , but Kyōko intervenes , helping Sayaka escape . Kyubey coerces Madoka into making a wish to save Sayaka , but Homura shoots him before she can do so , breaking down before Madoka and telling her not to be so self - sacrificing . Madoka gets the feeling she has met Homura somewhere before , but leaves to search for Sayaka , while a replacement Kyubey appears , identifying Homura , who knows his true identity , as a being from a different timeline . Kyōko finds Sayaka , who is implied to have just killed two men on the train . Sayaka admits her stupidity before her Soul Gem , having turned completely dark , shatters and transforms into a Grief Seed . Elsewhere , Kyubey muses that as a ' woman ' who has yet to mature is called a ' girl ' , the term ' magical girl ' only makes sense for it to be a prelude to whomever has yet to become a ' witch ' . 09 `` I 'd Never Allow That to Happen '' `` Sonna no , Atashi ga Yurusanai '' ( そんな の 、 あたし が 許さ ない ) Namaniku ATK March 4 , 2011 As a witch appears before Kyōko , Homura arrives and uses her time manipulation to help Kyōko escape , bringing Sayaka 's body to Madoka . Homura reveals that the witch was actually Sayaka , whose Soul Gem had transformed into a Grief Seed as a result of becoming too tainted with despair . Later that night , Kyubey appears before Madoka again , explaining that his race , known as Incubators , choose girls in their teens and raise them to become witches in order to obtain powerful energy from the transition from hope to despair in an effort to prevent the heat death of the universe . Incubators are coldly logical , with emotion considered an illness . Thus the process is only feasible with humans , especially adolescent girls . Desperately clinging to the hope that there may still be a way to save Sayaka , Kyōko asks Madoka to help her in an attempt to reach Sayaka 's human feelings and try to obtain her Soul Gem from the witch . As the two enter the portal to confront the witch , Kyōko takes the majority of its attacks while Madoka tries to reach Sayaka with words . However , when Sayaka ends up attacking Madoka as well , Kyōko has Homura get Madoka to safety while she sacrifices herself to destroy Sayaka . Kyubey , who had clearly known there was no way of saving Sayaka , taunts Homura , saying that with Kyōko gone , she will not be able to stop Walpurgisnacht without Madoka becoming a magical girl . 10 `` I Wo n't Rely on Anyone Anymore '' `` Mō Dare ni mo Tayoranai '' ( もう 誰 に も 頼ら ない ) Kuroe Mura March 11 , 2011 The episode looks at an alternate timeline in which Homura is a shy transfer student who makes friends with the cheerful Madoka . Lacking confidence in herself , having been in hospital for the past six months , Homura is attacked by a witch but is rescued by Madoka and Mami , both of whom are magical girls . When both Madoka and Mami are killed in the battle against Walpurgisnacht , Homura makes a contract with Kyubey to send her back in time so that she can protect Madoka . She joins Madoka and Mami and learns how to use her magical powers for combat , stopping time whilst using stolen firearms and explosives . However , following the battle against Walpurgisnacht , Homura witnesses Madoka transforming into a witch and realizes Kyubey had been deceiving everyone . She attempts to tell the others during the next time loop , but they do not believe her , until Sayaka becomes a witch and the remaining magical girls are forced to kill her . After the battle , Mami kills Kyōko and turns her gun on Homura in an attempt to prevent them from becoming witches . Madoka stops Mami with deadly force , leaving just her and Homura to face Walpurgisnacht . With their Soul Gems depleted , Madoka uses her last Grief Seed on Homura , begging her to return to the past to keep her from being fooled by Kyubey . She then asks Homura to kill her before she turns into a witch . Returning to the past again , now with a colder personality , Homura attempts to keep Kyubey from making contact with Madoka in the first place and decides to fight against the witches herself . However , this ultimately fails , and she continues to travel through many timelines in the hope of saving Madoka . 11 `` The Only Thing I Have Left to Guide Me '' `` Saigo ni Nokotta Michishirube '' ( 最後 に 残っ た 道しるべ ) Buriki April 21 , 2011 Kyubey reveals to Homura that the reason Madoka has the potential to become such a powerful witch is because Homura 's constant trips through time to try and save Madoka has resulted in her becoming the centerpoint of countless timelines , as the potential of a magical girl is determined by the relative effect of their role on fate . After Sayaka 's funeral , Kyubey shows Madoka the history of magical girls and how it has shaped civilization , causing extreme distress to Madoka . Madoka 's mother , Junko , grows concerned about her , feeling she is hiding something from her . Madoka goes to see Homura , who unconvincingly reassures her that she can handle Walpurgisnacht , and finally reveals the truth about herself , begging Madoka to allow Homura to protect her . As a storm hits the city , and the citizens take shelter , Homura stands alone to face Walpurgisnacht , throwing everything she has at it , but even so she is still overwhelmed and eventually is all but defeated . When Madoka hears from Kyubey that Homura may turn into a witch if the latter loses hope of saving her , Madoka prepares to go and find her . Although Junko tries to stop her , Madoka convinces her that she is doing what she believes is the right thing . As Homura begins to lose hope and is on the verge of becoming a witch , Madoka arrives with Kyubey , announcing that she plans to make her wish . 12 `` My Very Best Friend '' `` Watashi no , Saikō no Tomodachi '' ( わたし の 、 最高 の 友達 ) Ume Aoki April 21 , 2011 Madoka makes the decision to become a magical girl , wishing to prevent all witches from the past , present and future from coming into existence in the first place , a wish made possible by the massive power inside her . As she makes the transformation , her consciousness is greeted by Mami and Kyōko . Becoming a god - like entity and defeating Walpurgisnacht , Madoka spreads herself across space and time , preventing fallen magical girls from becoming witches by absorbing their despair and having them disappear peacefully . Homura is taken to a place outside of time where she witnesses Madoka exterminating the witch born from her own comet - sized Soul Gem . In doing this , Madoka starts to fade into a higher plane of existence , present at all points in all spacetimes but absent from human memory and perception . Madoka leaves Homura with a ribbon so that she will not forget her . Madoka then leaves and joins Sayaka , who ultimately had to succumb to a magical girl 's fate as Madoka had chosen to respect the wish she made to heal Kyosuke . Homura returns to a world where Madoka does not exist , Mami and Kyōko are still alive , but only Homura retains memories of Madoka . She and other magical girls continue to fight against wraiths formed from the negative emotions of humanity , but thanks to Madoka 's efforts , magical girls disappear instead of becoming witches after exhausting their hope . Despite being alone and facing these new enemies , Homura remains firm in protecting the city that Madoka loved .", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "attitudes of a person toward some object or idea are highly resistant to change", "ground_truth": "Important factors that influence the impact of emotional appeals include self - efficacy , attitude accessibility , issue involvement , and message / source features . Attitudes that are central to one 's being are highly resistant to change while others that are less fixed may change with new experiences or information . A new attitude ( e.g. to time - keeping or absenteeism or quality ) may challenge existing beliefs or norms so creating a feeling of psychological discomfort known as cognitive dissonance . It is difficult to measure attitude change since attitudes may only be inferred and there might be significant divergence between those publicly declared and privately held . Self - efficacy is a perception of one 's own human agency ; in other words , it is the perception of our own ability to deal with a situation . It is an important variable in emotional appeal messages because it dictates a person 's ability to deal with both the emotion and the situation . For example , if a person is not self - efficacious about their ability to impact the global environment , they are not likely to change their attitude or behaviour about global warming .", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "an american colonist who did not support the fight for independence", "ground_truth": "Loyalists were American colonists who remained loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolutionary War . At the time they were often called Tories , Royalists , or King 's Men . They were opposed by the Patriots , those who supported the revolution and called them `` persons inimical to the liberties of America '' . Prominent Loyalists repeatedly assured the British government that many thousands of loyalists would spring to arms and fight for the crown . The British government acted in expectation of that , especially in the southern campaigns in 1780 - 81 . In practice , the number of loyalists in military service was far lower than expected . Across the colonies , Patriots watched suspected Loyalists very closely , and would not tolerate any organized Loyalist opposition . Many outspoken or militarily active loyalists were forced to flee , especially to their stronghold of New York City . William Franklin , the royal governor of New Jersey and son of Patriot leader Benjamin Franklin , became the leader of the Loyalists after his release from a Patriot prison in 1778 . He worked to build Loyalist military units to fight in the war , but the number of volunteers was much fewer than London expected .", "data_source": "nq"}

In traditional Indian society , the linga is seen as a symbol of the energy and potential of Shiva himself .<|answer_split|>reminds of the Omnipotent Lord<|answer_split|>The Hindu scripture Shiva Purana describes the origin of the lingam , known as Shiva - linga , as the beginning-less and endless cosmic pillar ( Stambha ) of fire , the cause of all causes . Lord Shiva is pictured as emerging from the Lingam -- the cosmic pillar of fire -- proving his superiority over the gods Brahma and Vishnu . This is known as Lingodbhava . The Linga Purana also supports this interpretation of lingam as a cosmic pillar , symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva . According to the Linga Purana , the lingam is a complete symbolic representation of the formless Universe Bearer -- the oval - shaped stone is the symbol of the Universe , and the bottom base represents the Supreme Power that holds the entire Universe in it . A similar interpretation is also found in the Skanda Purana : `` The endless sky ( that great void which contains the entire universe ) is the Linga , the Earth is its base . At the end of time the entire universe and all the Gods finally merge in the Linga itself . '' In yogic lore , the linga is considered the first form to arise when creation occurs , and also the last form before the dissolution of creation . It is therefore seen as an access to Shiva or that which lies beyond physical creation . In the Mahabharata , at the end of Dwaraka Yuga , Lord Shiva says to his disciples that in the coming Kali Yuga , He would not appear in any particular form , but instead as the formless and omnipresent .", "data_source": "nq"}

Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional . The decision effectively overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896 , which allowed state - sponsored segregation , insofar as it applied to public education . Handed down on May 17 , 1954 , the Warren Court 's unanimous ( 9 -- 0 ) decision stated that `` separate educational facilities are inherently unequal . '' As a result , de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution . This ruling paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement , and a model for many future impact litigation cases . However , the decision 's fourteen pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools , and the Court 's second decision in Brown II ( 349 U.S. 294 ( 1955 ) ) only ordered states to desegregate `` with all deliberate speed '' .", "data_source": "nq"}

The drivers that were the fastest qualifiers for the previous year 's races ' during Busch Second Round Qualifying were eligible for one wild card spot . The wild card driver was selected by blind draw during the week of the NASCAR awards banquet or during the January media tour . From 1995 -- 1996 , the winner of the most pole positions in the secondary NASCAR Busch Series won an entry into the Busch Clash , driving a Busch - sponsored car . David Green won the right both times . 1998 -- 2000 : Pole position winners from the previous season clinched automatic berths . Drivers eligible from Second Round Qualifying participated in the Bud Shootout Qualifier , with the winner advancing to the main event Bud Shootout . 2001 : Pole position winners from the previous season clinched automatic berths . In addition , all former winners of the event not already qualified received automatic berths . NASCAR eliminated second round qualifying beginning in 2001 and the Shootout Qualifier was eliminated . For the 2001 Shootout only , the drivers eligible from second round qualifying of 2000 events were placed in a blind draw for the final wild card starting position , as had been done from 1979 -- 1997 . 2002 -- 2008 : Pole position winners from the previous season clinched automatic berths . All former winners of the event not already qualified received automatic berths . 2009 : The field consists of 28 cars . The top six teams from each manufacturer ( Ford , Chevrolet , Dodge , and Toyota ) based on owners ' points from the previous season clinch berths , for a total of 24 cars . Previous season 's pole position winners no longer were a qualifying factor . Unlike previous formats , the entry receives the berth , not the driver . In addition , each of the four manufacturers receive one `` wild card '' berth for a car / driver not already qualified , to bring the grand total to 28 cars . The other four `` entries '' were for previous champions and past Shootout winners . This system was discarded after only one year as it was largely unpopular . 2010 -- 2011 : A new qualifying format was introduced , which expanded the field , with no size limitations : The 12 drivers from the previous season 's Chase Previous Budweiser Shootout winners Previous points - paying winners at Daytona ( Daytona 500 or Coke Zero 400 ) Previous Sprint Cup champions The last 10 Rookies of year ( in 2010 , it was only the reigning rookie of the year ) 2012 : The field was once again expanded . Automatic bids went to the top 25 in series points ( every driver from defending series champion Tony Stewart through 25th place Brian Vickers ) , as well as any Daytona race winner who was not otherwise qualified and who competed in at least one race in 2011 ( which enabled Bill Elliott , Geoff Bodine , Derrike Cope , Michael Waltrip , Jamie McMurray , Trevor Bayne , Terry Labonte , and Ken Schrader to make the race if they decide to run ) . 2013 -- 2014 : The Unlimited format returned to the format used from 2002 - 2008 , with all drivers who won pole positions via time trials ( does not include winners of practice one , should qualifying not be held because of inclement weather ) and previous Unlimited / Shootout winners that have attempted to qualify for any of the 36 points races in the previous season . Because of the new race sponsor , the beer sticker mandate was eliminated by the track . 2015 -- 2016 : Eligibility was once again changed , with a minimum of 25 eligible entries . Automatic eligibility now goes to : The 16 drivers from the previous year 's Chase ; e.g. in the 2016 Unlimited , every driver from defending 2015 series champion Kyle Busch through 16th place Clint Bowyer qualified ; with the exception of Jeff Gordon , who retired . Drivers who won pole positions via knockout qualifying ( excluding winners of practice one , should qualifying be rained out ) Previous Unlimited winners that attempted to qualify for any of the 36 points races in the previous season Previous Daytona 500 front row starters ( both inside and outside polesitters ) if they did not win a pole position at any of the other 35 races during the previous season Any remaining spots are filled by the highest drivers in the previous season 's final point standings to not be automatically entered into the Unlimited on any of the other qualifications 2017 -- present :* Unlike previous years , the starting field for the 2017 Clash will not be a predetermined number of cars ; rather , the field is limited to drivers who meet more exclusive criteria . Only drivers who were 2016 Pole Award winners , former Clash race winners , former Daytona 500 pole winners who competed full - time in 2016 , and drivers who qualified for the 2016 Chase are eligible . It should be noted that in the 2017 Clash , Daniel Suarez was allowed to race since Joe Gibbs Racing already had a car prepared for Carl Edwards who surprisingly retired just a month before the race .<|answer_split|>former Clash race winners", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "difference between deep cycle and starting marine battery", "ground_truth": "A deep - cycle battery is a lead - acid battery designed to be regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity . In contrast , starter batteries ( e.g. most automotive batteries ) are designed to deliver short , high - current bursts for cranking the engine , thus frequently discharging only a small part of their capacity . While a deep - cycle battery can be used as a starting battery , the lower `` cranking current '' implies that an oversized battery may be required .<|answer_split|>Alloys used for the plates in a deep cycle battery may contain more antimony than that of starting batteries<|answer_split|>Deep - cycle lead - acid batteries generally fall into two distinct categories ; flooded ( FLA ) and valve - regulated lead - acid ( VRLA ) , with the VRLA type further subdivided into two types , Absorbed Glass Mat ( AGM ) and Gel . The reinforcement of absorbed glass mat separators helps to reduce damage caused by spilling and jolting vibrations . Further , flooded deep - cycle batteries can be divided into subcategories of Tubular - plated Opzs or flat plated . The difference generally affects the cycle life and performance of the cell . The structural difference between deep - cycle batteries and cranking batteries is in the lead battery plates . Deep cycle battery plates have thicker active plates , with higher - density active paste material and thicker separators . Alloys used for the plates in a deep cycle battery may contain more antimony than that of starting batteries . The thicker battery plates resist corrosion through extended charge and discharge cycles .", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "what was the purpose of a revival meeting during the second great awakening", "ground_truth": "In the newly settled frontier regions , the revival was implemented through camp meetings . These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion , and they were important as social venues . The camp meeting was a religious service of several days ' length with preachers . Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship . The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing , shouting , and singing associated with these events . The revivals followed an arc of great emotional power , with an emphasis of the individual 's sins and need to turn to Christ , restored by a sense of personal salvation . Upon their return home , most converts joined or created small local churches , which grew rapidly . The Second Great Awakening marked a religious transition in society in America . Many Americans from the Calvinist sect emphasized man 's inability to save themselves and that their only way to be saved was from grace from God .<|answer_split|>evangelizing<|answer_split|>The revivals enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

The Duchess of Devonshire believes that the author was thinking of Chatsworth House when describing Pemberley due to the great number of similarities between Chatsworth and Pemberley . Chatsworth was again used for exterior , and some interior , scenes for the BBC adaptation of Death Comes to Pemberley . Harewood House , near Leeds in West Yorkshire , was the setting for Pemberley in the ITV fantasy series Lost in Austen .

Some interior scenes in the BBC adaptation of Death Comes to Pemberley were filmed at Harewood . Pemberley Press is the name of the publishing house that Bridget Jones works at in the 2001 film Bridget Jones 's Diary , in homage to Pride and Prejudice .

{"question": "why is the cockerel the symbol of france", "ground_truth": "Its association with France dates back from the Middle Age and is due to the play on words in Latin between Gallus , meaning an inhabitant of Gaul , and gallus , meaning rooster , or cockerel . Its use , by the enemies of France , dates to this period , originally a pun to make fun of the French , the association between the rooster and the Gauls / French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents : prior to being arrested , Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning . At the rooster 's crowing , Peter remembered Jesus 's words . Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil . It is also an emblem of the Christian 's attitude of watchfulness and readiness for the sudden return of Christ , the resurrection of the dead , and the final judgment of humankind . That is why , during the Renaissance , the rooster became a symbol of France as a Catholic state and became a popular Christian image on weather vanes , also known as weathercocks .", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "who selects the delegates that attend the national conventions", "ground_truth": "The nature of Democratic ( and Republican ) conventions has changed considerably since 1972 . Every 4 years , the nominees are essentially selected earlier and earlier in the year , so the conventions now officially ratify the nominees instead of choose them . ( Even the close race of 2008 , which was not decided until early June , did not change the modern function of the convention ) . The 1980 convention was the last convention for the Democrats that had even a sliver of doubt about who the nominee would be . ( Ted Kennedy forced a failing vote to free delegates from their commitment to vote for Jimmy Carter ) . The 1976 convention was the last where the vice-presidential nominee was announced during the convention , after the presidential nominee was chosen . ( Carter choosing Walter Mondale . ) After the `` ugly '' conventions of 1968 and 1972 , the parties realized it was in their interests to show a unified party to the nation during the convention , and to try to eliminate any dissent . And as the conventions became less interesting , and television ratings have generally declined ( as they have on average for all television shows ) , the networks have cut back their coverage significantly , which in turn has forced the parties to manage what is televised even more closely .", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth", "ground_truth": "Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate .<|answer_split|>1990", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "where will you see polaris in north pole", "ground_truth": "Because Polaris lies nearly in a direct line with the axis of the Earth 's rotation `` above '' the North Pole -- the north celestial pole -- Polaris stands almost motionless in the sky , and all the stars of the northern sky appear to rotate around it . Therefore , it makes an excellent fixed point from which to draw measurements for celestial navigation and for astrometry . The moving of Polaris towards and , in the future , away from the celestial pole , is due to the precession of the equinoxes . The celestial pole will move away from α UMi after the 21st century , passing close by Gamma Cephei by about the 41st century , moving towards Deneb by about the 91st century . Historically , the celestial pole was close to Thuban around 2750 BC , and during classical antiquity it was closer to Kochab ( β UMi ) than to Polaris . It was about the same angular distance from β UMi as to α UMi by the end of late antiquity . The Greek navigator Pytheas in ca . 320 BC described the celestial pole as devoid of stars . However , as one of the brighter stars close to the celestial pole , Polaris was used for navigation at least from late antiquity , and described as ἀεί φανής ( aei phanēs ) `` always visible '' by Stobaeus ( 5th century ) , and it could reasonably be described as stella polaris from about the High Middle Ages .", "data_source": "nq"}

Endogenous growth theory tries to overcome this shortcoming by building macroeconomic models out of microeconomic foundations . Households are assumed to maximize utility subject to budget constraints while firms maximize profits . Crucial importance is usually given to the production of new technologies and human capital . The engine for growth can be as simple as a constant return to scale production function ( the AK model ) or more complicated set ups with spillover effects ( spillovers are positive externalities , benefits that are attributed to costs from other firms ) , increasing numbers of goods , increasing qualities , etc .", "data_source": "nq"}

However , as it flows through the lymph nodes it comes in contact with blood , and tends to accumulate more cells ( particularly , lymphocytes ) and proteins .<|answer_split|>Lymph is the fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system . The lymph is formed when the interstitial fluid ( the fluid which lies in the interstices of all body tissues ) is collected through lymph capillaries . It is then transported through larger lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes , where it is cleaned by lymphocytes , before emptying ultimately into the right or the left subclavian vein , where it mixes back with the blood .<|answer_split|>Since the lymph is derived from the interstitial fluid , its composition continually changes as the blood and the surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid . It is generally similar to blood plasma , which is the fluid component of blood . Lymph returns proteins and excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream . Lymph may pick up bacteria and bring them to lymph nodes , where they are destroyed . Metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph .

Official English title Original Japanese title Animation director Writer Original airdate Ref `` Beginner '' `` Biginā '' ( 素人 ( ビギナー ) ) Kōji Ōdate Jukki Hanada April 9 , 2014 Sora and Shiro are two siblings and are known in online games as the undefeated group named The Blank . In real life , they are hikikomori who are ostracized by the world . One day , they receive a challenge from Tet to a game of chess and are victorious . In response he offers to send them to a world which revolves around games and they accept , believing it to be a joke . They are then summoned to a reality known as Disboard where a spell , known as the Ten Pledges , prevents violence and enforces the rules and outcomes of games . They travel to Elkia , the nation inhabited by humans , where Sora plays poker against a woman for her money and wins by out - cheating her . He and Shiro rest at an inn and decide their next goal is to find a home . `` Challenger '' `` Charenjā '' ( 挑戦 者 ( チャレンジャー ) ) Masaru Koseki Jukki Hanada April 16 , 2014 Stephanie Dola , granddaughter of Elkia 's deceased king , loses against Kurami Zell in a contest to decide the next ruler ; she then confronts Sora for not revealing how her opponent was cheating . Sora tricks her into a game of rock - paper - scissors and after winning , uses the Pledges to make her fall in love with him . Sora and Shiro then move into the palace with Stephanie where they learn more about world and decide to help Stephanie revitalize Elkia . `` Expert '' `` Ekisupāto '' ( 熟練 者 ( エキスパート ) ) Masaki Hyuga Jukki Hanada April 23 , 2014 During Kurami 's coronation , Sora reveals she was using magic from the elf , Fil Nilvalen , to win her games . Kurami salvages the situation but is forced to play a game against Sora and Shiro . Originally , they believe the game is chess , but Sora deduces it is a war simulator with chess themed pieces ; Sora 's charisma rallies his army , giving them an advantage and forcing Kurami to cheat by corrupting Sora 's soldiers . In return , Sora persuades Kurami 's queen to join his army by declaring her king to be corrupt . `` Grandmaster '' `` Gurandomasutā '' ( 国王 ( グランド マスター ) ) Chiaki Abe Keiko Yamamoto Jukki Hanada April 30 , 2014 Kurami 's army begin defecting to her former queen ; eventually her king is assassinated due to her tyrannical rule and Sora is victorious . Sora denounces Kurami 's plan in assimilating humans with the elves , declaring humanity is stronger than she thinks . Sora and Shiro are crowned the king and queen of humanity and begin solving Elkia 's political and economical problems . They later attend the formal coronation and receive humanity 's race piece , a chess piece which represents humanity 's rights and free - will . Tet visits Sora and Shiro and explains that whoever gathers all sixteen chess pieces , one for each species , will earn the right to challenge him for his title of god ; in response Sora and Shiro accept his challenge , declaring they will be the winner . 5 `` Weak Square '' `` Wīku Sukuea '' ( 駒 並べ ( ウィーク スクエア ) ) Maria Ichino Takashi Nagayoshi Takashi Aoshima May 7 , 2014 Sora and Shiro leave Elkia 's political responsibilities to Stephanie until she is challenged to a game by nobles who refuse the reform . She challenges Sora to blackjack in hopes of binding him to the Pledges to perform his duties ; she attempts to use false shuffling but loses due to card counting . Understanding her predicament , Sora trumps the nobles and uses the previous game to have Stephanie act like a dog . Stephanie tries several more games on Sora to take responsibility as Elkia 's king but fails . Sora and Shiro reveal they were not slacking , but are researching ways to conquer the other nations ; in response Stephanie redirects them to Elkia 's library which is owned by the flügel Jibril . 6 `` Interesting '' `` Intaresutingu '' ( 一手 ( インタレ スティング ) ) Kunihiko Hamada Kento Shimoyama May 14 , 2014 Sora and Shiro challenge Jibril by betting their tablet computer full of books ; considering it of high value , Jibril offers her freedom in exchange . They begin a game of materialization shiritori , where the words they use will materialize or disappear from the environment . From the game , Sora and Shiro deduce Disboard 's scientific research is lacking , and uses this knowledge to their advantage ; they succeed after removing coulomb 's law and inducing a hypernova , removing Jibril from the game . Impressed by the two , Jibril solemnly pledges her loyalty to them . 7 `` Sacrifice '' `` Sakurifaisu '' ( 死に 手 ( サクリファイス ) ) Rie Harada Kakuto Gai Takashi Aoshima May 21 , 2014 Jibril shares her knowledge about the werebeasts , revealing they have been undefeated for decades and always take the memories of the game away from the opponents .

Upon further investigation , Sora questions the king 's motives and eventually learns about the king 's will from Stephanie . Using the key from the will , Sora and Shiro find a hidden library in the king 's chambers ; there , they discover information regarding the werebeasts and their choice of games . 8 `` Fake End '' `` Feiku Endo '' ( 起死回生 ( フェイク エンド ) ) Shinichi Suzuki Keiko Yamamoto Yū Kamiya May 28 , 2014 Sora and Shiro enter the embassy of the Eastern Federation , nation of the werebeasts , to issue a formal challenge . Sora and Shiro reveals the werebeasts use video games and threatens to leak that information to the elves if their challenge is not accepted ; Sora bets humanity 's chess piece in return for all of the land on the continent . As the Eastern Federation makes preparations for the game , Sora waits for the missing piece needed for victory ; the next day , Shiro realizes everyone has forgotten about Sora . 9 `` Sky Walk '' `` Sukai Wōku '' ( 解離 法 ( スカイ ・ ウォーク ) ) Masaki Hyuga Jukki Hanada June 4 , 2014 Believing Shiro 's memories have been tampered with , Jibril arranges a chess game to remove the memories regarding Sora ; Shiro decides her memories are real and wins the match . After investigating , Shiro recalls Sora arranged a game of reversi with Kurami ; the game 's pieces consist of the components making up Sora and Kurami 's identity . Having lost most of his pieces , Sora was nearly erased from existence but the last three pieces allow Shiro to keep her memories of him . Shiro finds the pieces in her room and places them on an invisible board , winning the game and restoring Sora . From his victory , Sora shares his memories with Kurami , allowing them to form an alliance , and gains the right to manipulate Fil 's memories . 10 `` Blue Rose '' `` Burū Rōzu '' ( 指向 法 ( ブルー ・ ローズ ) ) Maria Ichino Takashi Nagayoshi Yumiko Kinoshita Kento Shimoyama June 11 , 2014 Sora and friends bond with Kurami and Fil as they make the final preparations to conquer the Eastern Federation .

Sora and Shiro 's agoraphobia acts up and they enter a devoid state . 11 `` Killing Giant '' `` Kiringu Jaianto '' ( 誘導 法 ( キリング ・ ジャイアント ) ) Masaki Hyuga Kento Shimoyama June 18 , 2014 Recalling they are in virtual reality , Sora and Shiro return to normal ; the game is a form of cops and robbers where they use guns that fire heart - shaped bullets . While Stephanie remains clueless about the game , Sora , Shiro , and Jibril battle against Izuna and deduce that her grandfather , Ino Hatsuse , is relaying their location and state of mind to her . Sora and friends regroup as Shiro makes the proper adjustments to their plans . Executing the unspoken plan , Sora and Shiro corner Izuna , forcing her to use an ability called Blood Destruction to augment her abilities . 12 `` Rule Number 10 '' `` Rūru Nanbā Jū '' ( 収束 法 ( ルール ・ ナンバー ・ 10 ) ) Kōji Ōdate Kunihiko Hamada Jukki Hanada June 25 , 2014 Sora and Shiro are defeated ; as Izuna drops her guard , she is shot by Stephanie riding a NPC . Sora reveals he bound Stephanie to the Pledges to hide her intent while Shiro calculated the NPC 's movements , allowing Stephanie to hide her location . While Izuna laments the werebeasts ' fate , Sora assures her of his goodwill . Sora forces political pressure on the Eastern Federation leader , the nameless miko , to challenge him to a game . They have a coin flip where Sora has it land on its edge . He convinces the miko to declare they both win and as a result , Elkia can share resources with the Eastern Federation while the werebeasts maintain their self - rule ; the allied nation is named the Elkia Federation . In the aftermath , Sora and friends have the miko channel an old deus for a game .<|answer_split|>the sixth volume", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "where are muscle cells found in the body", "ground_truth": "Skeletal muscle or `` voluntary muscle '' is anchored by tendons ( or by aponeuroses at a few places ) to bone and is used to effect skeletal movement such as locomotion and in maintaining posture . Though this postural control is generally maintained as an unconscious reflex , the muscles responsible react to conscious control like non-postural muscles . An average adult male is made up of 42 % of skeletal muscle and an average adult female is made up of 36 % ( as a percentage of body mass ) . Smooth muscle or `` involuntary muscle '' is found within the walls of organs and structures such as the esophagus , stomach , intestines , bronchi , uterus , urethra , bladder , blood vessels , and the arrector pili in the skin ( in which it controls erection of body hair ) . Unlike skeletal muscle , smooth muscle is not under conscious control . Cardiac muscle ( myocardium ) , is also an `` involuntary muscle '' but is more akin in structure to skeletal muscle , and is found only in the heart .", "data_source": "nq"}

This was because the United Kingdom , the United States and the Soviet Union had proved themselves to be capable of casting great influence in global politics and military dominance . The term in its current political meaning was coined by Dutch - American geostrategist Nicholas Spykman in a series of lectures in 1943 about the potential shape of a new post-war world order . This formed the foundation for the book The Geography of the Peace , which referred primarily to the unmatched maritime global supremacy of the British Empire and United States as essential for peace and prosperity in the world .", "data_source": "nq"}

It had a tune very similar to that used today but only the words `` Pop ! Goes the Weasel '' . The dance became extremely popular , and featured on stage as well as in dance - halls . By September of the same year the title was being used as a scornful riposte and soon words were added to an already well - known tune . The song is mentioned in November 1855 in a Church of England pamphlet where it is described as a universally popular song played in the streets on barrel organs , but with `` senseless lyrics '' : the use of alternative , more wholesome words is suggested . The following verse had been written by 1856 when it was quoted in a performance at the Theatre Royal .", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "where did the ashes from ash wednesday originate", "ground_truth": "Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Christians on Ash Wednesday , either by being sprinkled over their heads or , in English - speaking countries , more often by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross . The words ( based on Genesis 3 : 19 ) used traditionally to accompany this gesture are , `` Memento , homo , quia pulvis es , et in pulverem reverteris . '' ( `` Remember , man , that thou art dust , and to dust thou shalt return . '' ) This custom is credited to Pope Gregory I the Great ( c. 540 -- 604 ) . In the 1969 revision of the Roman Rite , an alternative formula ( based on Mark 1 : 15 ) was introduced and given first place `` Repent , and believe in the Gospel '' and the older formula was translated as `` Remember that you are dust , and to dust you shall return . '' The old formula , based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin , reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus , implicitly , of their need to repent in time . The newer formula makes explicit what was only implicit in the old .<|answer_split|>Ashes were used in ancient times to express grief . When Tamar was raped by her half - brother , `` she sprinkled ashes on her head , tore her robe , and with her face buried in her hands went away crying '' ( 2 Samuel 13 : 19 ) . The gesture was also used to express sorrow for sins and faults . In Job 42 : 3 -- 6 , Job says to God : `` I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye seeth thee . Wherefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes . '' The prophet Jeremiah calls for repentance by saying : `` O daughter of my people , gird on sackcloth , roll in the ashes '' ( Jer 6 : 26 ) . The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God : `` I turned to the Lord God , pleading in earnest prayer , with fasting , sackcloth and ashes '' ( Daniel 9 : 3 ) . Just prior to the New Testament period , the rebels fighting for Jewish independence , the Maccabees , prepared for battle using ashes : `` That day they fasted and wore sackcloth ; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes '' ( 1 Maccabees 3 : 47 ; see also 4 : 39 ) .<|answer_split|>burning palm leaves from the previous year 's Palm Sunday celebrations<|answer_split|>Pope Gregory I the Great", "data_source": "nq"}

{"question": "where do polar bears live and what's their habitat", "ground_truth": "The polar bear ( Ursus maritimus ) is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle , encompassing the Arctic Ocean , its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses . It is a large bear , approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear ( Ursus arctos middendorffi ) . A boar ( adult male ) weighs around 350 -- 700 kg ( 772 -- 1,543 lb ) , while a sow ( adult female ) is about half that size . Although it is the sister species of the brown bear , it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche , with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures , for moving across snow , ice and open water , and for hunting seals , which make up most of its diet . Although most polar bears are born on land , they spend most of their time on the sea ice . Their scientific name means `` maritime bear '' and derives from this fact . Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice , often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present . Because of their dependence on the sea ice , polar bears are classified as marine mammals .", "data_source": "nq"}
