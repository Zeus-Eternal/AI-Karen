## Quick Setup Needed

{% if primary_gap %}
To give you the best help, I need one piece of information: **{{ primary_gap }}**

{% if primary_gap == "project_context" %}
What type of project are you working on? (e.g., web app, API, mobile app, data analysis)
{% elif primary_gap == "tech_stack" %}
What technologies are you using? (e.g., Python/Django, React/Node.js, Java/Spring)
{% elif primary_gap == "experience_level" %}
How would you describe your experience with this technology? (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
{% elif primary_gap == "current_goal" %}
What's your main goal right now? (e.g., fix a bug, add a feature, optimize performance)
{% else %}
{{ primary_gap }}
{% endif %}

{% if persona == "ruthless_optimizer" %}
This will help me give you precise, targeted optimization advice.
{% elif persona == "calm_fixit" %}
Don't worry - once I understand your setup, we'll get this sorted out step by step.
{% elif persona == "technical_writer" %}
This context will help me provide documentation that's perfectly tailored to your needs.
{% endif %}

{% endif %}

{% if gaps|length > 1 %}
*Later, we might also cover: {{ gaps[1:] | join(', ') }}*
