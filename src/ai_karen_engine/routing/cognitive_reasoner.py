"""Cognitive scaffolding for KIRE routing decisions.

The :class:`CognitiveReasoner` implements a lightweight cognitive
architecture inspired by global workspace theory and dual process models.
It synthesizes task analysis signals, user state, and profile metadata
to produce a deliberative vector that the router can use to steer model
selection in a more human-like manner.
