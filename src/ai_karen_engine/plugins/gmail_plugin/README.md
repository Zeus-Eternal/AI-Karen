# Gmail Plugin

This core plugin provides simple Gmail functionality used in tests and demos.
It supports two actions via parameters:

- `check_unread` – returns a mocked list of unread emails.
- `compose_email` – returns a mock confirmation message.

The plugin is intentionally minimal and does not integrate with the real Gmail API.
