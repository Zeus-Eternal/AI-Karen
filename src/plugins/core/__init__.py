Plugin Framework Core Module

This module contains the core framework code for the plugin system.
It provides the managers, routers, and utilities needed to build
and manage simple function-based plugins.

Key Components:
- PluginManager: Manages plugin lifecycle and discovery
- PluginRouter: Routes plugin requests and handles execution
- MemoryManager: Manages plugin memory and state (from marketplace)
- Sandbox: Provides secure execution environment for plugins

The plugin system is designed for simple, focused functions that
extend system capabilities without the complexity of full extensions.
