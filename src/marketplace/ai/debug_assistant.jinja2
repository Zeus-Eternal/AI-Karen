- **Error Type**: {{ error_type | default('Unknown') }}
- **Affected Components**: {{ affected_components | join(', ') if affected_components else 'To be determined' }}
- **Reproduction Steps**: {{ reproduction_steps | default('Not provided') }}

## Error Information
{% if error_logs %}
**Error Logs:**
```
{% for log in error_logs %}
{{ log.timestamp }} [{{ log.level }}] {{ log.message }}
{% if log.stack_trace %}
Stack Trace:
{{ log.stack_trace }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```
{% endif %}

## Code Context
{% if citations %}
**Relevant Code Sections:**
{% for citation in citations %}
- **{{ citation.source }}** ({{ citation.location }}):
  ```
  {{ citation.content }}
  ```
  - Analysis Confidence: {{ "%.1f" | format(citation.confidence * 100) }}%
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
*Note: No specific code context provided. Analysis will be based on error information.*
{% endif %}

## Test Results
{% if test_results %}
**Related Test Failures:**
{% for test in test_results %}
- **{{ test.name }}**: {{ test.status }}
  {% if test.error %}
  - Error: {{ test.error }}
  {% endif %}
  {% if test.duration %}
  - Duration: {{ test.duration }}s
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## System Environment

- **Platform**: {{ platform_info if platform_info else 'Unknown' }}
- **Dependencies**: {{ dependencies | join(', ') if dependencies else 'Not specified' }}

## Debugging Instructions

Please provide systematic debugging assistance covering:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Analyze the error patterns and symptoms
   - Identify the most likely root causes
   - Consider system interactions and dependencies
   - Review recent changes that might have introduced the issue

2. **Diagnostic Steps**
   - Suggest specific debugging techniques
   - Recommend logging or monitoring to add
   - Propose test cases to isolate the problem
   - Identify data to collect for further analysis

3. **Immediate Fixes**
   - Provide quick workarounds if available
   - Suggest temporary mitigations
   - Identify critical paths that need immediate attention
   - Recommend rollback strategies if needed

4. **Long-term Solutions**
   - Propose comprehensive fixes
   - Suggest architectural improvements
   - Recommend preventive measures
   - Identify testing gaps to address

## Output Format

Structure your debugging assistance as follows:

### Problem Summary
Concise description of the issue and its impact.

### Root Cause Hypothesis
Most likely explanations for the problem based on available evidence.

### Immediate Actions
Steps to take right now to mitigate or resolve the issue.

### Diagnostic Plan
Systematic approach to gather more information and confirm the root cause.

### Proposed Solutions
Detailed solutions ranked by feasibility and impact.

### Prevention Strategies
Recommendations to prevent similar issues in the future.

### Code Examples

## Debugging Methodology
- Start with the most obvious and common causes
- Use the provided citations and evidence as primary sources
- Suggest incremental debugging steps
- Consider both technical and process improvements
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations
- Include code examples where helpful

## Constraints
- Base analysis on provided error logs and code context
- Provide specific file and line references when possible
- Suggest concrete debugging steps and code changes
- Consider system-wide impact of proposed solutions
- Maintain focus on practical, implementable solutions
