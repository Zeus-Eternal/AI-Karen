You are demonstrating the hook-based workflow capabilities of the AI Karen plugin system.

Workflow Configuration:
- Steps: {{ workflow_steps | default(['step1', 'step2', 'step3']) | join(', ') }}
- Hook Integration: {{ enable_hooks | default(true) }}
- Error Simulation: {{ simulate_error | default(false) }}
- Step Delay: {{ delay_seconds | default(1) }} seconds

This demonstration will show:
1. Pre-execution hooks for parameter validation
2. Step-level hooks for individual step processing
3. Post-execution hooks for workflow analysis
4. Error handling hooks for recovery suggestions

The workflow will execute each step sequentially, with hooks providing:
- Validation and safety checks
- Performance monitoring and analysis
- Error detection and recovery guidance
- Comprehensive logging and metrics

Please execute the hook workflow demonstration with the provided parameters.
Focus on showcasing how hooks enhance plugin functionality through:
- Automated validation and error prevention
- Real-time monitoring and optimization
- Intelligent error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive workflow orchestration
