# PR Plan: Web UI Production Audit Implementation

## Overview
This PR plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of the comprehensive Web UI audit fixes, organized into manageable phases with proper testing, feature flags, and rollback procedures.

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches
- `main` - Production branch
- `develop` - Development integration branch
- `audit/web-ui-fixes` - Main feature branch for audit fixes

### Feature Branches (created from `audit/web-ui-fixes`)
- `audit/security-foundation` - Security fixes and RBAC
- `audit/architecture-refactor` - Component decomposition
- `audit/performance-optimization` - Performance improvements
- `audit/accessibility-enhancement` - A11y improvements
- `audit/testing-infrastructure` - Test coverage improvements

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Security Foundation (Week 1)
**Priority: Critical - Must be completed first**

#### Branch: `audit/security-foundation`
```bash
git checkout -b audit/security-foundation develop
```

#### Files to Create/Modify:
1. `src/components/security/SanitizedMarkdown.tsx` ✅
2. `src/components/security/RBACGuard.tsx` ✅
3. `src/lib/telemetry.ts` ✅
4. `src/hooks/use-feature.ts` ✅
5. `src/contexts/FeatureFlagsContext.tsx` ✅

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install dompurify marked @types/dompurify
   npm install --save-dev @types/marked
   ```

2. **Create Security Components**
   - Copy `SanitizedMarkdown.tsx` from FIX_PACK
   - Copy `RBACGuard.tsx` from FIX_PACK
   - Update all existing markdown rendering to use SanitizedMarkdown

3. **Implement Feature Flags**
   - Copy `FeatureFlagsContext.tsx` from FIX_PACK
   - Copy `use-feature.ts` from FIX_PACK
   - Add FeatureFlagsProvider to app layout

4. **Add Telemetry Foundation**
   - Copy `telemetry.ts` from FIX_PACK
   - Create telemetry hook: `src/hooks/use-telemetry.ts`

5. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SECURITY_SANITIZATION=true
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SECURITY_RBAC=true
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
   ```

#### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Unit tests for security components
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=security

# Security vulnerability scan
npm audit
npm run lint:security

# Manual testing checklist
# - Verify markdown sanitization blocks XSS
# - Test RBAC guards hide/show content based on roles
# - Confirm external links have noopener/noreferrer
```

#### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] All user content goes through SanitizedMarkdown
- [ ] External links have `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- [ ] RBACGuard components protect sensitive features
- [ ] Feature flags work correctly
- [ ] Telemetry events are captured
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Security tests pass

#### Rollback Plan:
- Feature flags can instantly disable new security features
- Fallback to original components if issues arise
- Database rollback not required (UI-only changes)

### Alert Thresholds
- Error rate >1%
- Bundle size >200KB
- First token >600ms
- Accessibility score <95%

## Rollback Procedures

### Instant Rollback (Feature Flags)
```bash
# Disable problematic feature immediately
curl -X POST /api/admin/feature-flags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"feature": "performance.virtualization", "enabled": false}'
```

### Component Rollback (5 minutes)
```bash
# Revert to previous component version
git checkout main
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

### Full Deployment Rollback (15 minutes)
```bash
# Rollback entire deployment
git checkout main
git reset --hard <previous-stable-commit>
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Emergency Database Rollback (30 minutes)
```bash
# Only if data migration issues (unlikely for UI changes)
kubectl exec -it postgres-pod -- psql -d kari -c "ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT pre_ui_audit;"
```
