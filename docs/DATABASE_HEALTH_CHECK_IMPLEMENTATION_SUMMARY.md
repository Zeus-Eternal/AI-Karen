# Database Health Check Implementation Summary

## Task 3: Add database connection health check functionality

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive database connection health check functionality for the AI Karen system. This implementation addresses the requirements for validating database connectivity during startup, monitoring connection pool health, and providing detailed logging without exposing credentials.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Enhanced Database Client Classes

**File:** `src/ai_karen_engine/database/client.py`

##### New Data Structures

- **`ConnectionPoolMetrics`**: Dataclass for tracking connection pool health metrics
  - Pool size, checked out connections, overflow, invalid connections
  - Timestamp for metrics collection

- **`DatabaseHealthStatus`**: Comprehensive health check result structure
  - Health status (healthy/unhealthy)
  - Response time measurements
  - Connection pool metrics
  - Error details (sanitized)
  - Timestamp information

##### Enhanced DatabaseClient Methods

1. **`comprehensive_health_check()`**: 
   - Performs detailed database connectivity validation
   - Collects connection pool metrics
   - Measures response times
   - Logs results with sanitized credentials

2. **`startup_health_check()`**:
   - Multi-step validation during application startup
   - Tests basic connectivity, database version, connection pool, and transactions
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - Comprehensive error reporting

3. **`async_comprehensive_health_check()`**:
   - Async version of comprehensive health check
   - Full async/await support
   - Same detailed metrics and logging

4. **`_get_connection_pool_metrics()`**:
   - Extracts real-time connection pool statistics
   - Safe handling of different pool implementations
   - Graceful degradation if metrics unavailable

5. **`_sanitize_database_url()`**:
   - Removes passwords and sensitive information from URLs
   - Safe for logging and error reporting
   - Regex-based credential masking

##### Enhanced MultiTenantPostgresClient

1. **`health_check_with_tenant_support()`**:
   - Tenant-specific health validation
   - Schema existence checking
   - Multi-tenant aware error reporting

2. **`async_health_check_with_tenant_support()`**:
   - Async version of tenant-specific health checks
   - Full async/await support

#### 2. Convenience Functions

Added global convenience functions for easy integration:

- `comprehensive_database_health_check()`
- `startup_database_health_check()`
- `async_comprehensive_database_health_check()`
- `get_database_connection_pool_metrics()`

#### 3. Integration with Health Monitor System

- Can be registered as health check functions
- Provides structured health data for monitoring
- Supports both sync and async health monitoring

### Requirements Compliance

#### Requirement 1.4: Database Connection Validation
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Comprehensive health checks validate database connectivity during startup and runtime

#### Requirement 4.1: Connection Monitoring
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Real-time connection pool monitoring with detailed metrics

#### Requirement 4.3: Secure Logging
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: All logging sanitizes credentials and provides structured error information

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Health Check
```python
from ai_karen_engine.database.client import MultiTenantPostgresClient

client = MultiTenantPostgresClient()
health_status = client.comprehensive_health_check()

if health_status.is_healthy:
    print(f"Database healthy - Response time: {health_status.response_time_ms}ms")
else:
    print(f"Database unhealthy: {health_status.message}")
```

#### Startup Health Validation
```python
from ai_karen_engine.database.client import startup_database_health_check

startup_health = startup_database_health_check()
if not startup_health.is_healthy:
    print(f"Startup health check failed: {startup_health.message}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

#### Connection Pool Monitoring
```python
from ai_karen_engine.database.client import get_database_connection_pool_metrics

metrics = get_database_connection_pool_metrics()
print(f"Pool size: {metrics.pool_size}, Active: {metrics.checked_out}")
```

#### Health Monitor Integration
```python
from ai_karen_engine.core.health_monitor import get_health_monitor
from ai_karen_engine.database.client import MultiTenantPostgresClient

async def database_health_check():
    client = MultiTenantPostgresClient()
    health_status = client.comprehensive_health_check()
    return {
        "status": "healthy" if health_status.is_healthy else "unhealthy",
        "message": health_status.message,
        "response_time_ms": health_status.response_time_ms
    }

monitor = get_health_monitor()
monitor.register_health_check("database", database_health_check, interval=30)
```
