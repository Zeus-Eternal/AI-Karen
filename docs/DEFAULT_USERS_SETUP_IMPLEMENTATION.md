# Default Users Setup Implementation

## Overview

The consolidated authentication service now automatically creates default users during initialization to ensure the system is ready to use out of the box. This addresses Requirement 7 in the auth-service-consolidation specification.

## Implementation Details

### Automatic User Creation

The `AuthService.initialize()` method now includes a call to `_setup_default_users()` which automatically creates essential default users if they don't already exist in the database.

### Default Users Created

#### 1. Admin User
- **Email**: `admin@kari.ai` (configurable via `AUTH_DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL`)
- **Password**: `password123` (configurable via `AUTH_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
- **Roles**: `["admin", "user"]`
- **Purpose**: System administration and management
- **Created in**: All environments

#### 2. Anonymous User
- **Email**: `anonymous@karen.ai` (configurable via `AUTH_ANONYMOUS_EMAIL`)
- **Password**: `anonymous` (configurable via `AUTH_ANONYMOUS_PASSWORD`)
- **Roles**: `["anonymous"]`
- **Purpose**: Unauthenticated operations and guest access
- **Created in**: All environments

#### 3. Test User
- **Email**: `test@example.com` (configurable via `AUTH_TEST_USER_EMAIL`)
- **Password**: `testpassword` (configurable via `AUTH_TEST_USER_PASSWORD`)
- **Roles**: `["user"]`
- **Purpose**: Development and testing
- **Created in**: Development/testing environments only

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to customize default user credentials:

| Variable | Default Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `AUTH_DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@kari.ai` | Admin user email address |
| `AUTH_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `password123` | Admin user password |
| `AUTH_ANONYMOUS_EMAIL` | `anonymous@karen.ai` | Anonymous user email address |
| `AUTH_ANONYMOUS_PASSWORD` | `anonymous` | Anonymous user password |
| `AUTH_TEST_USER_EMAIL` | `test@example.com` | Test user email address |
| `AUTH_TEST_USER_PASSWORD` | `testpassword` | Test user password |

## Environment-Specific Behavior

### Production Environment
- Creates admin user for system administration
- Creates anonymous user for unauthenticated operations
- **Does NOT** create test user for security reasons

### Development/Testing Environment
- Creates admin user for system administration
- Creates anonymous user for unauthenticated operations
- Creates test user for development and testing purposes

## Key Features

### 1. Duplicate Prevention
- Checks if users already exist before attempting to create them
- Skips creation of existing users to prevent duplicates
- Logs which users were created vs. skipped

### 2. Error Handling
- Continues with other users if one user creation fails
- Logs errors but doesn't break the initialization process
- Non-critical for service operation (helpful but not required)

### 3. User Verification
- All default users are automatically marked as verified
- Ready to use immediately without email verification

### 4. Comprehensive Logging
- Logs user creation activities
- Shows default credentials in development environments
- Provides clear feedback on setup status

## Code Implementation

### Location
The implementation is in `src/ai_karen_engine/auth/service.py` in the `AuthService` class:

- `initialize()` method calls `_setup_default_users()`
- `_setup_default_users()` method contains the implementation logic

### Key Code Sections

```python
async def _setup_default_users(self) -> None:
    """
    Setup default users during authentication service initialization.
    
    Creates essential default users if they don't already exist:
    - Admin user for system administration
    - Anonymous user for unauthenticated operations
    - Test user for development/testing (only in non-production environments)
    """
    # Implementation creates users based on environment and configuration
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from ai_karen_engine.auth.config import AuthConfig
from ai_karen_engine.auth.service import AuthService

# Create and initialize auth service
config = AuthConfig()
auth_service = AuthService(config)
await auth_service.initialize()  # Default users are created automatically

# Users are now available in the database
admin_user = await auth_service.get_user_by_email("admin@karen.ai")
anonymous_user = await auth_service.get_user_by_email("anonymous@karen.ai")
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
import os

# Set custom credentials
os.environ['AUTH_DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL'] = 'admin@mycompany.com'
os.environ['AUTH_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD'] = 'secure-admin-password'

# Initialize service
config = AuthConfig()
auth_service = AuthService(config)
await auth_service.initialize()

# Custom admin user is created
admin_user = await auth_service.get_user_by_email("admin@mycompany.com")
```

### Production Setup
```python
# Set production environment
config = AuthConfig()
config.environment = "production"

auth_service = AuthService(config)
await auth_service.initialize()

# Only admin and anonymous users are created (no test user)
```

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- Default passwords are simple for development convenience
- **IMPORTANT**: Change default passwords in production environments
- Consider using environment variables for secure password management

### User Roles
- Admin user has full system access
- Anonymous user has limited access for unauthenticated operations
- Test user has standard user permissions

### Environment Separation
- Test user is only created in development/testing environments
- Production environments get minimal necessary users

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify:

1. **Default User Creation**: All expected users are created in appropriate environments
2. **Environment-Specific Behavior**: Test user only created in development
3. **Custom Environment Variables**: Custom credentials are respected
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Existing users are not recreated
5. **Error Handling**: Failures don't break initialization

### Running Tests
```bash
python test_default_users_simple.py
```

## Migration from Existing Scripts

### Replaced Scripts
This implementation replaces the need for separate user creation scripts:
- `create_admin_user.py`
- `create_anonymous_user.py`
- `create_test_user.py`
- `setup_test_user.py`
- `scripts/setup_single_admin.py`

### Benefits of Integrated Approach
- **Automatic**: No manual script execution required
- **Consistent**: Same logic across all deployments
- **Environment-aware**: Adapts to different environments automatically
- **Configurable**: Easy customization via environment variables
- **Reliable**: Built into the service initialization process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Users Not Created
- Check that `AuthService.initialize()` is being called
- Verify database connectivity and schema initialization
- Check logs for error messages during user creation

#### Wrong Credentials
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check that environment variables are loaded before service initialization
- Ensure no typos in environment variable names

#### Duplicate Users
- The system automatically prevents duplicates
- If you see "already exists" messages, this is normal behavior
- Existing users are preserved and not modified

### Debug Logging
Enable debug logging to see detailed user creation process:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('ai_karen_engine.auth.service').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Role-based default users**: Create users with specific roles based on configuration
2. **Tenant-specific defaults**: Create default users for each tenant
3. **Password complexity validation**: Ensure default passwords meet security requirements
4. **User profile customization**: Allow more detailed user profile setup
5. **Bulk user creation**: Support creating multiple users from configuration files

### Configuration Improvements
1. **YAML/JSON configuration**: Support configuration files for complex setups
2. **Database-driven configuration**: Store default user configuration in database
3. **Dynamic user creation**: Create users based on runtime conditions

## Conclusion

The default users setup functionality ensures that the AI Karen authentication system is ready to use immediately after initialization. This addresses the requirement for automatic user creation during setup and provides a seamless out-of-the-box experience for developers and administrators.

The implementation is:
- ✅ **Automatic**: Integrated into service initialization
- ✅ **Configurable**: Customizable via environment variables
- ✅ **Environment-aware**: Adapts to different deployment environments
- ✅ **Safe**: Prevents duplicates and handles errors gracefully
- ✅ **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

This completes the implementation of Requirement 7: "Make sure our default users are in the DB and auto-created during setup."
