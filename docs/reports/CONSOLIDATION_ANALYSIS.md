## Conclusion

The consolidation of FIX_PACK into ui_launchers/web_ui is a complex but necessary task that will significantly enhance the security, performance, and maintainability of the web UI. The modular nature of both codebases makes integration feasible, but careful planning and execution are required to avoid regressions and ensure all improvements are properly integrated.

The analysis shows that most FIX_PACK features can be successfully integrated with minimal conflicts, and the resulting codebase will be significantly more robust and production-ready.
