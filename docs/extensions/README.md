- **Background Processing**: Scheduled tasks and event handling
- **Secure Storage**: Isolated data storage with encryption
- **Marketplace Distribution**: Easy discovery and installation

## Getting Started

### For Users

1. **Browse Extensions**: Visit the marketplace to discover available extensions
2. **Install Extensions**: Use the web interface or CLI to install extensions
3. **Configure Settings**: Customize extension behavior through settings
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track extension usage and performance

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# List available extensions
kari extension search

# Install an extension
kari extension install task-manager

# Check status
kari extension status task-manager
```

### For Developers

1. **Read the Development Guide**: Understand the extension architecture
2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Install required tools and dependencies
3. **Create Your First Extension**: Use the scaffolding tools
4. **Test and Deploy**: Validate your extension and publish to marketplace

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Create new extension
kari extension create my-first-extension

# Develop with hot reload
kari extension dev ./my-first-extension --watch
