# Kari UI/UX Blueprint

This document outlines the high level design goals for the Kari user interface. It is intended as a living reference for future development.

## Conversational Intelligence
- Persistent multi-turn chat with markdown rendering and file previews.
- Context panel showing what Kari remembers in the current session.
- Controls to change persona, tone, language and emotional style on the fly.
- Guardrails and transparency indicators.

## Multi-Modal Interactions
- Voice input and TTS output using local providers when available.
- Drag and drop file uploads with OCR and table parsing.
- Quick summaries and task extraction from documents.

## Plugin and Automation Ecosystem
- Plugin store UI for browsing and managing extensions.
- Workflow builder with drag and drop triggers and actions.
- Visualisation of running tasks and agent chat.

## Memory and Knowledge Graph
- Session memory explorer with timeline view.
- Editable profile panel for strengths and interests.
- Graph view showing relations between entities.

## Model and Provider Management
- Switch between LLM backends with usage stats and benchmarking.
- Credential vault with secure storage and rotation UI.
- Fallback analytics showing token usage and cost.

## Privacy and Security
- All on-device data stores encrypted by default.
- Transparency log of what Kari has stored with delete/export options.
- Consent flows for personal profiling and EchoCore learning.

This blueprint acts as a guideline for building a modular, user focused interface. Features should remain configurable through feature flags and developed as independent components under the `ui_launchers/` directory.
