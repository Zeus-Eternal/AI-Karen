print(f"CPU: {metrics.cpu_percent}%, Memory: {metrics.memory_percent}%")
```

### Automatic Monitoring with Context Manager
```python
async with create_default_resource_monitor() as monitor:
    # Monitoring starts automatically
    await asyncio.sleep(10)  # Monitor for 10 seconds
    # Monitoring stops automatically
```

### Custom Alert Handling
```python
def handle_alert(alert):
    if alert.level == AlertLevel.CRITICAL:
        # Send notification to administrators
        send_notification(f"Critical resource alert: {alert.message}")

monitor.add_alert_callback(handle_alert)
```

### Cache Registration for Automatic Cleanup
```python
# Register caches for automatic cleanup during memory pressure
monitor.register_cache("user_cache", user_cache_object)
monitor.register_cache("session_cache", session_cache_object)
