# AsyncTaskOrchestrator Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Task 5 from the runtime performance optimization spec: "Implement async task orchestrator for parallel processing". This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for CPU-intensive task offloading, parallel processing, and async/await patterns to prevent main thread blocking.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. AsyncTaskOrchestrator Class (`src/ai_karen_engine/core/async_task_orchestrator.py`)

**Core Features:**
- **Background Worker Pool Management**: Manages both process and thread pools for optimal task distribution
- **CPU-Intensive Task Offloading**: Automatically offloads CPU-bound tasks to separate processes using ProcessPoolExecutor
- **Parallel Task Execution**: Executes multiple tasks concurrently with proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Async/Await Wrapper**: Prevents main thread blocking by wrapping synchronous operations in async contexts
- **Task Batching and Scheduling**: Optimizes throughput through intelligent batching and priority-based scheduling

**Key Methods:**
- `offload_cpu_intensive_task()`: Offloads CPU-bound work to process pool
- `schedule_parallel_tasks()`: Executes multiple tasks in parallel with priority support
- `wrap_blocking_operation()`: Wraps blocking operations to prevent main thread blocking
- `batch_process_tasks()`: Processes tasks in optimized batches
- `create_background_worker_pool()`: Creates persistent background workers

### 2. Task Management System

**Data Models:**
- `Task`: Represents a task with metadata (ID, function, args, priority, timeout, retry settings)
- `TaskResult`: Contains execution results with success status, timing, and error information
- `TaskType`: Enum for task classification (CPU_INTENSIVE, IO_BOUND, BLOCKING_OPERATION)
- `TaskPriority`: Priority levels for task scheduling (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- `WorkerPoolConfig`: Configuration for worker pool management

### 3. Background Worker Pool

**Features:**
- Persistent background workers for continuous task processing
- Configurable worker count and lifecycle management
- Automatic task distribution and result collection
- Graceful startup and shutdown procedures

### 4. Error Handling and Resilience

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
- Graceful error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting

### 5. Performance Optimization Features

**Optimizations:**
- Intelligent task type detection and routing
- Priority-based task scheduling
- Resource-aware worker pool sizing
- Efficient memory management and cleanup
- Performance metrics collection and monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Requirements Addressed

✅ **Requirement 6.1**: CPU-intensive tasks utilize async/await patterns to prevent blocking
- Implemented through `offload_cpu_intensive_task()` and process pool management

✅ **Requirement 6.2**: Multiple concurrent tasks execute in parallel using thread pools and async queues
