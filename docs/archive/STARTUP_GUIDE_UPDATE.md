#### 1. **Core Platform Features** (Overview Section)
- Added "Performance Optimization" as a key platform feature
- Highlighted dual startup modes with performance metrics

#### 2. **Quick Performance Note** (Before Quick Start)
- Added prominent callout about two startup modes
- Referenced performance improvements (99%+ faster, 50%+ memory reduction)

#### 3. **Enhanced Launch Services Section**
- Replaced simple startup instruction with comprehensive guide
- Added detailed comparison of both startup modes
- Included environment configuration examples

#### 4. **New Performance & Optimization Section**
- Comprehensive resource management feature overview
- Detailed optimization profiles explanation
- Complete environment variable documentation
- Configuration references

## The Two Startup Files Explained

### `start.py` - Standard Mode
**Purpose**: Full-featured development startup
**Characteristics**:
- All services load immediately
- 3-5 second startup time
- Standard memory usage
- Best for development and debugging

**When to Use**:
- Local development
- Feature testing
- Debugging sessions
- When you need all features immediately available

### `start_optimized.py` - Optimized Mode  
**Purpose**: Resource-efficient production startup
**Characteristics**:
- Lazy loading of services
- <1 second startup (99%+ improvement)
- 50%+ memory reduction
- Automatic resource cleanup

**When to Use**:
- Production deployments
- Container environments
- Resource-constrained systems
- CI/CD pipelines
- When startup speed is critical

## Environment Variables for Optimization

```bash
# Basic optimization
KARI_LAZY_LOADING=true          # Enable lazy service loading
KARI_MINIMAL_STARTUP=true       # Start only essential services

# Advanced optimization  
KARI_ULTRA_MINIMAL=true         # Extreme resource conservation
KARI_RESOURCE_MONITORING=true   # Enable resource monitoring
KARI_DEFER_AI_SERVICES=true     # Defer AI model loading
KARI_AUTO_CLEANUP=true          # Automatic service cleanup
```

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose `start.py` if**:
- You're developing locally
- You need all features immediately
- Startup time isn't critical
- You have abundant resources

**Choose `start_optimized.py` if**:
- You're deploying to production
- You're using containers
- Resources are limited
- Fast startup is important
- You want efficient resource usage

## Configuration Files

- `config/performance.yml` - Detailed optimization settings
- `.env.optimized` - Optimized environment variables
- See Performance & Optimization section in README for full details

## Benefits of the Optimization System

1. **Faster Deployments**: 99%+ startup improvement
2. **Resource Efficiency**: 50%+ memory reduction
3. **Scalability**: Better container density
4. **Cost Savings**: Lower resource consumption
5. **Flexibility**: Multiple optimization levels
6. **Monitoring**: Built-in resource tracking

The documentation now provides clear guidance on which startup file to use based on your specific needs and environment.
