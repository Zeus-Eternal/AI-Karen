# Task 5 Implementation Summary: Integrate with Existing Security and Auth Systems

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive security and authentication integration for the Model Orchestrator system, extending existing RBAC, adding license tracking, and integrating security validation with existing systems.

## Task 5.1: Extend Existing RBAC for Model Operations ✅

### Implementation Details:
- **Extended RBAC Scopes**: Added model-specific scopes to existing RBAC system:
  - `model:read` - Permission to browse and view model information
  - `model:download` - Permission to download models
  - `model:remove` - Permission to remove models
  - `model:migrate` - Permission to migrate model layouts
  - `model:admin` - Administrative model operations

- **Updated Role Mappings**: Extended default role scopes:
  - `admin`: Full model permissions including admin operations
  - `user`: Read and download permissions
  - `readonly`: Read-only access to model information
  - `guest`: No model permissions

- **Security Manager**: Created `ModelSecurityManager` class with methods:
  - `check_download_permission()` - Validates download permissions
  - `check_migration_permission()` - Validates migration permissions
  - `check_remove_permission()` - Validates removal permissions
  - `check_browse_permission()` - Validates read-only access
  - `check_admin_permission()` - Validates admin operations

- **API Integration**: Updated all model orchestrator API endpoints with:
  - Permission checks using the security manager
  - RBAC middleware integration
  - Proper error handling for permission denials

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/ai_karen_engine/security/model_security.py` - Main security manager
- `src/ai_karen_engine/api_routes/model_orchestrator_routes.py` - API security integration

## Task 5.2: Add License Tracking to Existing Systems ✅

### Implementation Details:
- **License Manager**: Created comprehensive license management system:
  - `LicenseManager` class for tracking license acceptances
  - Storage of acceptance records with user ID, timestamp, IP address
  - License compliance checking and validation
  - Compliance reporting with audit trails

- **License Acceptance Workflow**:
  - Pre-download license compliance checks
  - Interactive license acceptance dialogs
  - Blocking of downloads until license acceptance
  - Audit logging of all license events

- **Web UI Components**:
  - `LicenseDialog.tsx` - Interactive license acceptance dialog
  - `LicenseCompliancePanel.tsx` - Admin compliance dashboard
  - Integration with existing `ModelDownloadDialog.tsx`

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/models/license/accept` - Accept model license
  - `GET /api/models/license/compliance/{model_id}` - Check compliance
  - `GET /api/models/license/report` - Generate compliance reports

- **License Types Support**:
  - Open source licenses
  - Restricted licenses (research-only, non-commercial)
  - Commercial licenses
  - Custom license agreements

### Files Created/Modified:
- `ui_launchers/web_ui/src/components/models/LicenseDialog.tsx` - License acceptance UI
- `ui_launchers/web_ui/src/components/models/LicenseCompliancePanel.tsx` - Compliance dashboard
- `ui_launchers/web_ui/src/components/models/ModelDownloadDialog.tsx` - Updated with license integration
- License management integrated into `ModelSecurityManager`

## Task 5.3: Integrate Security Validation with Existing Systems ✅

### Implementation Details:
- **Security Utilities**: Created comprehensive security validation utilities:
  - `ModelFileValidator` - File integrity and checksum validation
  - `ModelOwnerValidator` - Owner allowlist/denylist validation
  - `ResourceQuotaManager` - Storage quota and resource management
  - `ModelSecurityIntegrator` - Unified security validation

- **File Security Features**:
  - SHA256 checksum verification for all downloaded files
  - Automatic quarantine of files with failed validation
  - File integrity monitoring and reporting
  - Cleanup of old quarantined files

- **Owner Security**:
  - Configurable allowlist/denylist for model owners
  - Validation before download initiation
  - Security policy enforcement

- **Resource Management**:
  - Storage quota enforcement per user/tenant
  - Disk space monitoring and validation
  - Model size limits and validation
  - Resource usage tracking

- **Audit Integration**:
  - Extended existing audit logging framework
  - Security event logging with correlation IDs
  - Integration with existing compliance systems
  - Structured logging for security events

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/models/security/validate` - Pre-download security validation
  - `POST /api/models/security/validate-files` - Post-download file validation
  - `POST /api/models/security/cleanup` - Security artifact cleanup

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/ai_karen_engine/utils/model_security_utils.py` - Security validation utilities
- Enhanced `ModelSecurityManager` with comprehensive validation methods
- Extended `ModelAuditLogger` with security event integration
- Updated API routes with security validation endpoints
