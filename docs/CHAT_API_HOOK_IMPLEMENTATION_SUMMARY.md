# Chat API Hook Implementation Summary

## Task 4: Extend existing chat API with hook capabilities

This document summarizes the implementation of hook capabilities for the existing chat API as part of the AG-UI + CopilotKit chat enhancement project.

## Implementation Overview

The task has been successfully completed with the following components implemented:

### 1. ChatOrchestrator Hook Integration ✅

**File:** `src/ai_karen_engine/chat/chat_orchestrator.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Added hook manager integration to the ChatOrchestrator
- Implemented hook execution points at key stages of message processing:
  - **Pre-message hooks**: Triggered before message processing begins
  - **Message-processed hooks**: Triggered after successful message processing
  - **Post-message hooks**: Triggered after response generation
  - **Message-failed hooks**: Triggered when message processing fails
- Added comprehensive error handling for hook failures to ensure system resilience
- Enhanced response metadata to include hook execution statistics
- Implemented hook support for both traditional and streaming message processing

**Hook Execution Points:**
```python
# Pre-message hooks
pre_hook_summary = await hook_manager.trigger_hooks(pre_message_context)

# Message processed hooks (on success)
processed_hook_summary = await hook_manager.trigger_hooks(message_processed_context)

# Post-message hooks (on success)
post_hook_summary = await hook_manager.trigger_hooks(post_message_context)

# Message failed hooks (on failure)
failed_hook_summary = await hook_manager.trigger_hooks(message_failed_context)
```

### 2. Hook Management API Endpoints ✅

**File:** `src/ai_karen_engine/api_routes/hook_routes.py`

**Endpoints Implemented:**
- `POST /api/hooks/register` - Register new hooks

    hook_type=HookTypes.PRE_MESSAGE,
    data={
        "message": "user message",
        "user_id": "user_123",
        "conversation_id": "conv_456",
        "session_id": "session_789",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "correlation_id": "req_123",
        "attachments": ["file1.txt"],
        "metadata": {"key": "value"}
    },
    user_context={
        "user_id": "user_123",
        "conversation_id": "conv_456",
        "session_id": "session_789"
    }
)
```

### Hook Registration Example
```python
hook_id = await hook_manager.register_hook(
    hook_type=HookTypes.PRE_MESSAGE,
    handler=my_hook_handler,
    priority=100,
    conditions={"user_roles": ["admin"]},
    source_type="plugin",
    source_name="my_plugin"
)
```

### Response Metadata Enhancement
```python
ChatResponse(
    response="AI response",
    correlation_id="req_123",
    processing_time=0.5,
    used_fallback=False,
    context_used=True,
    metadata={
        "pre_hooks_executed": 2,
        "processed_hooks_executed": 1,
        "post_hooks_executed": 2,
        "total_hooks_executed": 5,
        "parsed_entities": 3,
        "embedding_dimension": 768,
        # ... other metadata
    }
)
```
