metadata = {"conversation_id": "conv-123", "user_id": "user-456"}
response = requests.post("/api/files/upload", files=files, data={"metadata": json.dumps(metadata)})
```

### Code Execution
```python
# Execute Python code
request = {
    "code": "print('Hello, World!')\nresult = 2 + 2\nprint(f'Result: {result}')",
    "language": "python",
    "user_id": "user-123",
    "conversation_id": "conv-456",
    "security_level": "strict"
}
response = requests.post("/api/code/execute", json=request)
```

### Tool Usage
```python
# Use calculator tool
request = {
    "tool_name": "calculator",
    "parameters": {"expression": "2 + 2 * 3"},
    "user_id": "user-123",
    "conversation_id": "conv-456"
}
response = requests.post("/api/code/tools/execute", json=request)
```

### Chat Integration
```python
# Chat with file attachment
request = {
    "message": "Please analyze the attached document",
    "user_id": "user-123",
    "conversation_id": "conv-456",
    "attachments": ["file-id-789"],
    "stream": False
}
response = requests.post("/api/chat/process", json=request)
```

## Performance Considerations
