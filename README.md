# Kari AI

> **Local-first, plugin-driven, self-evolving.**
> Kari turns a single FastAPI service and a desktop Control Room into an autonomous “Ops Mesh” that can route intents, run domain capsules, and refactor its own code—without leaving your machine.

 
Kari is a modular, headless-first AI system built for enterprise deployments.
The stack ships with robust intent detection, a plugin router, and a
Tauri-based desktop control room. Memory and reasoning subsystems are tuned for
production workloads.

## 1 · Overview

 
* Intent detection engine with runtime-configurable regex rules
* Robust plugin router with manifest validation and RBAC dispatch
* Dual vector memory (Milvus + Redis) with surprise weighting
* Thread-safe Milvus client supporting TTL and metadata filters
* Recency-weighted memory store with automatic TTL pruning and async queries
* Local-first LLM orchestration (LNM + OSIRIS)
* HuggingFace-powered generation for SelfRefactor and automation
* HuggingFace LLM plugin with auto-download helper
* Optional OpenAI plugin for hosted inference
* **SelfRefactor Engine** with sandboxed testing, RL-based patch merging, and
  dynamic LLM backend selection (HF, DeepSeek or OpenAI)
* Configurable SRE scheduler (default weekly) continuously improves the codebase
* NANDA client enables cross-agent snippet sharing
* **Hydra-Ops Mesh** with capsule planner, event bus and guardrails
* Example plugins: hello world, desktop agent, TUI fallback, hf_llm, openai_llm
* Tauri desktop Control Room for chat, dashboard and memory matrix
* Streamlit mobile UI for API demo
* Prometheus metrics, tracing and EchoCore logging

Kari is a **modular, headless-first AI system** designed for on-prem or air-gapped environments.
The stack ships with:

* an intent engine and role-based plugin router
* a **SelfRefactor Engine** that patches its own code every hour
* dual-tier vector memory (Milvus + Redis) with surprise & recency weighting
* a **Tauri** desktop Control Room (React+Rust) for ops, metrics, and logs

Everything runs locally by default; cloud APIs are optional, opt-in plugins.

### Prerequisites
* Docker and Docker Compose
* Node.js 18+ with npm
* Rust toolchain (`cargo`) for Tauri builds


---

## 4 · Quick-Start

```bash
# 1 · Install Python deps
./scripts/install.sh

# 2 · Install Control Room packages
cd desktop_ui/frontend && npm install && cd ../..

# 3 · Launch backend API + dependencies
./scripts/start.sh

# 4 · Run desktop Control Room (dev mode)
cd desktop_ui && npx tauri dev

```

**Full stack (API + Milvus + Redis + Prometheus):**

```bash
# after use
./scripts/stop.sh
```

Build signed desktop binaries:
```bash
cd desktop_ui
npx tauri build         # outputs .app / .exe / .AppImage
```

Run tests:
 

```bash
pytest -q
```

## 🔧 Local Dev Setup

### 1. Install Prerequisites

```bash
brew install rustup
rustup-init
source $HOME/.cargo/env
npm install -g pnpm
cargo install tauri-cli
```

### 2. Start FastAPI

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. Start Frontend (optional)

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### 4. Start Tauri Desktop App

```bash
cd desktop_ui
pnpm install
npx tauri dev
```

📦 Ensure `tauri.conf.json` is under `desktop_ui/src-tauri/`

### API Usage

Kari's FastAPI backend exposes a small set of endpoints for headless deployments.
See [docs/api_usage.md](docs/api_usage.md) for the full list and example `curl`
commands.

## 5 · Development Cheatsheet

 
# Launch Control Room
cd desktop_ui && npx tauri dev

| Task               | Command                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Format             | `black .`                              |
| Type-check         | `mypy .`                               |
| Lint               | `ruff .`                               |
| Tests              | `pytest`                               |
| Hot-reload plugins | just save the folder—Kari auto-detects |
### Advanced / Unrestricted Mode

Set `ADVANCED_MODE=true` to enable full SelfRefactor logs and allow plugin UIs marked as untrusted. Use with caution.

 

---

## 6 · Writing a Plugin

1. `mkdir plugins/my_plugin`
2. Add **manifest.json**

```json
{
  "name": "my_plugin",
  "description": "Says hello",
  "plugin_api_version": "0.1.0",
  "required_roles": ["user"]
}
```

3. Add **handler.py**

```python
def run(message, context):
    return "Hello from my_plugin!"
```

4. (Optional) **prompt.txt** for extra context or **ui.py** to extend the Control Room.

Drop the folder—Kari discovers it, registers routes, and injects UI automatically.

---

## 7 · Control Room
 

* **Dashboard** – CPU/RAM, capsule health, error feed
* **LLM Manager** – download / switch local models via `/models` endpoints
* **Plugins** – enable, disable, edit manifests live
* **Memory Matrix** – inspect vector hits & decay curves
* **Logs & Trace** – Prometheus charts, OT spans, SRE patch history

Runs as a native Tauri app; all traffic stays on `localhost`.

 
Run the API with `uvicorn main:app` and start the Tauri Control Room for a
full-featured desktop experience.

| **Desktop-only** | Tauri binary spawns embedded FastAPI                         | offline / air-gapped          |
| **Kubernetes**   | Helm chart `charts/kari/`                                    | GKE, EKS, on-prem             |

 
 
* Local: `docker-compose.yml` (FastAPI, Milvus, Redis, Prometheus)
* Cloud: Helm chart for K8s + GKE/EKS
