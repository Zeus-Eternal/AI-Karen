# AI-Karen

This project contains a minimal prototype of the Kari AI stack. It includes:

- A simple intent engine and plugin router.
- Example plugins (hello world, desktop agent, TUI fallback).
- Vector-based memory with embeddings and an in-memory Milvus client.
- Soft reasoning engine storing and querying memories.
- Basic FastAPI application with chat, store, search and metrics endpoints.
- Streamlit admin pages for chat, dashboard and memory matrix.

Run tests with `pytest -q`.
