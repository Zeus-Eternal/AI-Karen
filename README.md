Kari is a modular, headless-first AI system built for enterprise deployments.
The stack ships with robust intent detection, a plugin router, and a
Tauri-based desktop control room. Memory and reasoning subsystems are tuned for
production workloads.

# Kari AI

 
* Intent detection engine with runtime-configurable regex rules
* Robust plugin router with manifest validation and RBAC dispatch
* Dual vector memory (Milvus + Redis) with surprise weighting
* Thread-safe Milvus client supporting TTL and metadata filters
* Recency-weighted memory store with automatic TTL pruning and async queries
* Local-first LLM orchestration (LNM + OSIRIS)
* HuggingFace-powered generation for SelfRefactor and automation
* HuggingFace LLM plugin with auto-download helper
* Optional OpenAI plugin for hosted inference
* **SelfRefactor Engine** with sandboxed testing and RL-based patch merging
* Hourly SRE scheduler continuously improves the codebase
* NANDA client enables cross-agent snippet sharing
* **Hydra-Ops Mesh** with capsule planner, event bus and guardrails
* Example plugins: hello world, desktop agent, TUI fallback, hf_llm, openai_llm
* Tauri desktop Control Room for chat, dashboard and memory matrix

## Features

* **Intent Engine** ‚Äî simple regex matcher (to be upgraded to CORTEX predictor)
* **Prompt-First Plugin Router** ‚Äî manifest-based discovery, sandbox execution, RBAC
* **NANDA Bridge** ‚Äî cross-agent snippet sharing with local MCP node
* **Dual Vector Memory** ‚Äî Milvus + Redis with surprise weighting and TTL pruning
* **Local LLM Orchestration** ‚Äî EchoCore LNM + OSIRIS for context synthesis
* **SelfRefactor Engine (SRE)** ‚Äî DeepSeek + RL loop for automated code improvement
* **Hourly Refactor Scheduler** ‚Äî continuous self-patching & testing
* **Admin UI (Streamlit)** ‚Äî dashboards, LLM manager, plugins, memory matrix, trace logs
* **Observability** ‚Äî Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, EchoCore immutable logs
* **Example Plugins** ‚Äî hello world, desktop agent, TUI fallback

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the API
uvicorn main:app --reload

 
# Launch the Control Room
cd desktop_ui && npx tauri dev

# Launch Admin UI
streamlit run admin_ui/Main.py
 

# Run tests (recommended)
pytest -q

# Start full stack: vector DB, Redis, Kari API, Prometheus
docker compose up
 

# Launch Control Room
cd desktop_ui && npx tauri build

 

 
```

---

## Development

* Format: `black .`
* Type-check: `mypy .`
* Lint: `ruff .`
* Test: `pytest`

---

## Plugin Example

1. Create `plugins/my_plugin/`
2. Add `manifest.json`, `handler.py`, optional `prompt.txt` and `ui.py`
3. Drop folder ‚Äî Kari auto-discovers & injects UI.

---

## Control Room

* **Dashboard:** System health, CPU/RAM, model status
* **LLM Manager:** Switch local models, manage downloads
* **Plugins:** View, enable/disable, configure
* **Memory Matrix:** Vector hits, decay curves
* **Logs/Trace:** Prometheus metrics, execution trace

---

## Deployment

 
Run the API with `uvicorn main:app` and start the Tauri Control Room for a
full-featured desktop experience.

* **Local:** `docker-compose.yml` spins up FastAPI, Milvus, Redis, Prometheus, Streamlit.
* **Cloud:** Use the provided Helm chart for K8s (GKE/EKS) for Phase 5 scale-out.
 

See `DEV_SHEET.md` for the full architecture spec and sprint roadmap.

 

 
* Local: `docker-compose.yml` (FastAPI, Milvus, Redis, Prometheus)
* Cloud: Helm chart for K8s + GKE/EKS
