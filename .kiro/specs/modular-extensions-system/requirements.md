# Modular Extensions System Requirements

## Introduction

The Kari AI platform currently has an excellent plugin system for small, focused handlers. However, there's a need for a higher-level system that allows developers to build substantial, modular enhancements to the core platform. This "Extensions" system will enable complex functionality that can compose multiple plugins, provide rich UIs, manage their own data, and be distributed through a marketplace.

Extensions differ from plugins in scope and capability:
- **Plugins**: Small, focused intent handlers (e.g., "hello_world", "time_query")  
- **Extensions**: Large, feature-rich modules (e.g., "CRM Integration", "Advanced Analytics Dashboard", "Multi-Agent Workflow Builder")

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Extension Architecture and Discovery

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want to create substantial system enhancements that go beyond simple intent handling, so that I can build complex features like dashboards, integrations, and workflow systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an extension is placed in the extensions directory THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and register it
2. WHEN an extension has a valid manifest THEN the system SHALL load its capabilities and make them available
3. IF an extension has dependencies THEN the system SHALL validate and resolve them before loading
4. WHEN an extension is loaded THEN it SHALL be able to register multiple API endpoints, UI components, and background services
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL provide a registry of all available extensions with their capabilities

### Requirement 2: Extension Manifest and Metadata

**User Story:** As an extension developer, I want a comprehensive manifest system that declares my extension's capabilities, dependencies, and requirements, so that the platform can properly integrate and manage my extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an extension THEN I SHALL define a manifest with name, version, description, and capabilities
2. WHEN declaring dependencies THEN I SHALL specify required plugins, other extensions, and system services
3. WHEN defining permissions THEN I SHALL declare what system resources my extension needs access to
4. WHEN specifying UI components THEN I SHALL declare what interface elements my extension provides
5. WHEN publishing metadata THEN I SHALL include marketplace information like category, pricing, and compatibility

### Requirement 3: Extension Plugin Orchestration

**User Story:** As an extension developer, I want to compose and orchestrate multiple plugins within my extension, so that I can build complex workflows that leverage existing plugin capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my extension needs plugin functionality THEN I SHALL be able to invoke any available plugin through a standard interface
2. WHEN orchestrating plugins THEN I SHALL be able to chain plugin calls and pass data between them
3. WHEN a plugin fails THEN my extension SHALL receive proper error handling and be able to implement fallback strategies
4. WHEN managing plugin state THEN I SHALL be able to maintain context across multiple plugin invocations
5. WHEN plugins are updated THEN my extension SHALL continue to work with backward compatibility

### Requirement 4: Extension Data Management

**User Story:** As an extension developer, I want dedicated data storage and management capabilities, so that my extension can maintain its own state, configuration, and user data independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my extension needs data storage THEN I SHALL have access to tenant-isolated database schemas
2. WHEN storing extension data THEN it SHALL be automatically segregated by tenant and user context
3. WHEN accessing data THEN I SHALL have both SQL and NoSQL storage options available
4. WHEN managing configuration THEN I SHALL have persistent settings storage with validation
5. WHEN handling user data THEN all storage SHALL respect privacy and compliance requirements

### Requirement 5: Extension UI Integration

**User Story:** As an extension developer, I want to integrate rich user interfaces into the Kari platform, so that users can interact with my extension through native-feeling interfaces in both desktop and web environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing UI components THEN I SHALL be able to register them in the Control Room desktop app
2. WHEN creating web interfaces THEN I SHALL be able to add pages to the Streamlit admin interface
3. WHEN building interactive elements THEN I SHALL have access to the platform's design system and components
4. WHEN handling user interactions THEN my UI SHALL have access to the current user context and permissions
5. WHEN displaying data THEN my UI SHALL integrate with the platform's real-time update mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Extension API and Service Registration

**User Story:** As an extension developer, I want to expose APIs and background services, so that other extensions and external systems can integrate with my functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating APIs THEN I SHALL be able to register FastAPI routers with custom endpoints
2. WHEN exposing services THEN they SHALL be automatically included in the platform's API documentation
3. WHEN handling authentication THEN my APIs SHALL integrate with the platform's auth and RBAC system
4. WHEN running background tasks THEN I SHALL be able to register scheduled jobs and event handlers
5. WHEN providing webhooks THEN I SHALL be able to expose endpoints for external system integration

### Requirement 7: Extension Marketplace and Distribution

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to discover, install, and manage extensions from a marketplace, so that I can easily extend the platform's capabilities without manual installation processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing extensions THEN I SHALL see a marketplace interface with categories, ratings, and descriptions
2. WHEN installing an extension THEN the system SHALL handle dependency resolution and installation automatically
3. WHEN updating extensions THEN I SHALL receive notifications and be able to update with one click
4. WHEN managing extensions THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable them per tenant or globally
5. WHEN removing extensions THEN the system SHALL clean up all associated data and configurations

### Requirement 8: Extension Security and Isolation

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want extensions to run in secure, isolated environments, so that malicious or buggy extensions cannot compromise the platform or other extensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an extension executes THEN it SHALL run within defined resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
2. WHEN accessing system resources THEN extensions SHALL only access what they've declared in their manifest
3. WHEN handling data THEN extensions SHALL only access data within their tenant/user scope
4. WHEN communicating between extensions THEN it SHALL go through controlled interfaces with permission checks
5. WHEN an extension fails THEN it SHALL not affect the core platform or other extensions

### Requirement 9: Extension Development Tools

**User Story:** As an extension developer, I want comprehensive development tools and documentation, so that I can efficiently build, test, and debug my extensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting development THEN I SHALL have CLI tools to scaffold new extensions
2. WHEN testing extensions THEN I SHALL have a local development environment with hot reloading
3. WHEN debugging THEN I SHALL have access to logs, metrics, and debugging interfaces
4. WHEN validating extensions THEN I SHALL have tools to check manifest validity and compatibility
5. WHEN publishing extensions THEN I SHALL have tools to package and submit to the marketplace

### Requirement 10: Extension Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive lifecycle management for extensions, so that I can monitor their health, performance, and impact on the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extensions are running THEN I SHALL see their status, resource usage, and performance metrics
2. WHEN extensions have issues THEN I SHALL receive alerts and diagnostic information
3. WHEN managing versions THEN I SHALL be able to rollback to previous versions if needed
4. WHEN monitoring usage THEN I SHALL see analytics on extension adoption and performance
5. WHEN planning capacity THEN I SHALL have data on resource consumption by extension
