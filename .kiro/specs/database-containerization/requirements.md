# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a streamlined database setup and deployment system using Docker containers to simplify the database infrastructure for AI Karen. The system will provide easy-to-use Docker containers for all database components, making it simple for developers and users to get the complete database stack running with minimal configuration. This will replace complex manual database setup processes with a single-command deployment solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single Docker command to set up all required databases so that I can quickly get the AI Karen system running without complex database configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run a single Docker command THEN the system SHALL start all required database services (PostgreSQL, vector database, etc.)
2. WHEN the database containers start THEN the system SHALL automatically run all necessary migrations and schema setup
3. WHEN the containers are initialized THEN the system SHALL create default users, permissions, and initial data
4. IF database containers already exist THEN the system SHALL preserve existing data and only update schema as needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database containers to be production-ready so that I can deploy them in various environments with proper persistence and backup capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database containers are deployed THEN the system SHALL use persistent volumes for data storage
2. WHEN containers are configured THEN the system SHALL include proper backup and restore mechanisms
3. WHEN the system runs THEN the database containers SHALL support environment-specific configuration through environment variables
4. WHEN containers are started THEN the system SHALL include health checks and monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database setup to include all AI Karen-specific schemas and data so that the system is immediately ready for use after container startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database containers initialize THEN the system SHALL create all tables defined in the migration files
2. WHEN the schema is set up THEN the system SHALL include extension-specific tables and relationships
3. WHEN initial data is loaded THEN the system SHALL populate bootstrap data for classifiers and system configuration
4. WHEN the setup completes THEN the system SHALL verify all database connections and schema integrity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear documentation and simple commands so that I can easily understand how to start, stop, and manage the database containers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include clear setup instructions with example commands
2. WHEN containers are managed THEN the system SHALL provide simple scripts for start, stop, restart, and reset operations
3. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL include common problem resolution steps
4. WHEN configuration is required THEN the system SHALL document all available environment variables and their purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database containers to integrate seamlessly with the existing AI Karen codebase so that no code changes are required for database connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are running THEN the system SHALL use the same connection parameters as the existing database configuration
2. WHEN the AI Karen application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to containerized databases without code modifications
3. WHEN multiple environments are used THEN the system SHALL support development, testing, and production database configurations
4. WHEN containers are deployed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing database client code
