# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate and convert the existing web UI components with the AI Karen engine, creating a unified system that leverages both the modern web interface and the powerful backend capabilities. The integration will involve converting TypeScript/JavaScript logic to Python for global engine use, adopting Google's Genkit framework for AI flows, creating shared UI components across different launchers, and implementing proper tool/agent abstractions that follow the project's architectural guidelines.

4. WHEN error handling is standardized THEN the system SHALL implement consistent error handling across all backend integrations
5. WHEN authentication patterns are unified THEN the system SHALL create shared authentication services for all UI launchers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user experience designer, I want the web UI's advanced features like proactive suggestions and memory integration to be available across all AI Karen interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN proactive suggestion logic is converted THEN the system SHALL implement Python services that can generate contextual suggestions
2. WHEN memory integration is enhanced THEN the system SHALL create services that provide consistent memory access across all UIs
3. WHEN conversation context is managed THEN the system SHALL implement shared context management that works across different interfaces
4. WHEN user personalization is standardized THEN the system SHALL create services that maintain user preferences across all launchers
5. WHEN AI insights are shared THEN the system SHALL implement services that provide consistent AI-generated insights across interfaces

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want the web UI's plugin integration patterns to be available as reusable Python services so that I can create plugins that work consistently across all interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugin interfaces are standardized THEN the system SHALL create Python abstractions that work with existing plugin architecture
