# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a Node.js-based UI launcher for the AI Karen system, providing a modern web interface built with Node.js technologies. The Node UI will serve as an alternative frontend to the existing Streamlit and desktop UI options, offering better performance, customization capabilities, and modern web development practices. This launcher will integrate with the existing AI Karen backend services and provide a responsive, accessible user interface for interacting with the AI assistant.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Node.js-based UI launcher so that I can have a modern, performant web interface with better customization options and standard web development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Node UI is started THEN the system SHALL serve a web application on a configurable port
2. WHEN a user accesses the Node UI THEN the system SHALL display a responsive web interface compatible with modern browsers
3. WHEN the Node UI initializes THEN the system SHALL connect to the AI Karen backend services
4. IF the backend services are unavailable THEN the Node UI SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the AI Karen chat interface through the Node UI so that I can communicate with the AI assistant in a familiar web environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the Node UI THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface with message history
2. WHEN a user types a message and submits it THEN the system SHALL send the message to the AI Karen backend and display the response
3. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history and display it chronologically
4. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL support real-time message updates and typing indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Node UI to provide access to AI Karen's core features so that I can utilize all available functionality through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates the Node UI THEN the system SHALL provide access to plugin management features
2. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of AI Karen preferences and parameters
3. WHEN a user views system status THEN the system SHALL display health information and active services
4. WHEN a user manages files THEN the system SHALL provide file upload, download, and management capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Node UI to follow modern web development practices so that it's maintainable, scalable, and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Node UI is built THEN the system SHALL use a modern Node.js framework (React, Vue, or similar)
2. WHEN the codebase is structured THEN the system SHALL follow component-based architecture patterns
3. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use npm or yarn with proper package.json configuration
4. WHEN the application is developed THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and logging mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Node UI to be responsive and accessible so that I can use it effectively across different devices and accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Node UI is accessed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively
2. WHEN users with accessibility needs access the interface THEN the system SHALL support screen readers and keyboard navigation
3. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
4. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and loading states

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Node UI to integrate seamlessly with the existing AI Karen architecture so that it works alongside other UI launchers without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Node UI is deployed THEN the system SHALL coexist with existing Streamlit and desktop UI launchers
2. WHEN the Node UI connects to backend services THEN the system SHALL use the same API endpoints as other UI launchers
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL read from the same configuration sources as the main application
4. WHEN the Node UI is started THEN the system SHALL not interfere with other running UI components
