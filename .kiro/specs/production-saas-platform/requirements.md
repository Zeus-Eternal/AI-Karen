# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform AI-Karen from its current state into a production-ready, enterprise-grade, multi-tenant SaaS platform. The transformation encompasses comprehensive backend auditing and fixes, security hardening with multi-tenant data isolation, modern CI/CD pipelines, observability infrastructure, and a streamlined architecture optimized for scalability and maintainability. The resulting platform will be capable of serving multiple organizations with enterprise-level security, performance, and reliability guarantees.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want a comprehensive backend audit and fix implementation so that all code issues, security vulnerabilities, and architectural problems are resolved before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend audit is performed THEN the system SHALL identify and catalog all syntax errors, missing imports, broken dependencies, and anti-patterns
2. WHEN code fixes are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide complete, standalone code solutions with proper type hints, error handling, and comprehensive test coverage
3. WHEN security vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL implement fixes that follow security best practices and include penetration testing validation
4. WHEN architectural issues are identified THEN the system SHALL provide refactored solutions that improve maintainability, scalability, and performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a SaaS provider, I want comprehensive multi-tenant architecture with data isolation so that multiple organizations can use the platform securely without data leakage or cross-tenant access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tenants are onboarded THEN the system SHALL create isolated data namespaces across all storage systems (Milvus, Redis, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch)
2. WHEN users access the system THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant-scoped authentication and authorization with role-based access control
3. WHEN data operations are performed THEN the system SHALL automatically filter all queries, updates, and deletions by tenant context
4. WHEN tenant isolation is tested THEN the system SHALL demonstrate zero cross-tenant data access under all test scenarios

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want enterprise-grade security hardening so that the platform meets compliance requirements and protects against common attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is implemented THEN the system SHALL support OAuth2, SAML, and enterprise SSO integration with multi-factor authentication
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limiting, input validation, and comprehensive audit logging
3. WHEN sensitive data is processed THEN the system SHALL implement encryption at rest and in transit with proper key management
4. WHEN security policies are applied THEN the system SHALL include automated vulnerability scanning, dependency checking, and security headers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want modern CI/CD pipelines with comprehensive testing so that deployments are automated, reliable, and include proper quality gates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically run linting, type checking, unit tests, and integration tests
2. WHEN builds are created THEN the system SHALL generate container images with security scanning and vulnerability assessment
3. WHEN deployments are triggered THEN the system SHALL support automated staging and production deployments with rollback capabilities
4. WHEN quality gates are evaluated THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum test coverage, security scan passes, and performance benchmarks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive observability and monitoring so that system health, performance, and usage can be tracked and optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL emit Prometheus metrics for all critical components with custom dashboards
2. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL generate OpenTelemetry traces with distributed tracing across all services
3. WHEN events occur THEN the system SHALL produce structured logs with correlation IDs and searchable metadata
4. WHEN alerts are configured THEN the system SHALL provide automated alerting for performance degradation, errors, and resource exhaustion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a streamlined and debloated architecture so that the platform focuses on core functionality with optional features clearly separated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the architecture is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify unused code, optional features, and overly complex modules
2. WHEN core functionality is defined THEN the system SHALL implement a minimal core with plugin-based optional features
3. WHEN configuration is managed THEN the system SHALL provide clear toggle flags for all optional components
4. WHEN deployment options are provided THEN the system SHALL support minimal, standard, and full-featured deployment modes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want robust data management with backup, recovery, and migration capabilities so that data integrity and availability are guaranteed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL implement automated backup strategies with point-in-time recovery
2. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide safe, reversible migration scripts with validation
3. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL have automated recovery procedures with integrity checking
4. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of database components with load balancing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit logging and data governance so that all system activities are tracked and regulatory requirements are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log all activities with immutable audit trails
2. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL record who accessed what data when with full context
3. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate automated compliance reports for various regulations
4. WHEN data retention policies are applied THEN the system SHALL automatically enforce data lifecycle management

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized system performance with auto-scaling capabilities so that the platform can handle variable loads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale compute resources based on demand
2. WHEN performance bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL identify and alert on performance issues with recommendations
3. WHEN caching is implemented THEN the system SHALL use intelligent caching strategies to minimize database load
4. WHEN resource usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL optimize resource allocation and provide cost optimization recommendations

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want comprehensive analytics and business intelligence so that platform usage, revenue, and growth metrics can be tracked and analyzed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business events occur THEN the system SHALL track key performance indicators and business metrics
2. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards with drill-down capabilities
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL create automated business reports with trend analysis
4. WHEN billing is calculated THEN the system SHALL track usage-based billing with detailed cost breakdowns per tenant
