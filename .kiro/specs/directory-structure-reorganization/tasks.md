## Migration Strategy

### Pre-Migration Checklist

1. **Backup Creation**: Full backup of current codebase
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Complete mapping of all dependencies
3. **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage exists
4. **Communication Plan**: Notify all stakeholders of migration
5. **Rollback Plan**: Detailed rollback procedures prepared

### Migration Execution Order

1. **Plugin System First**: Move plugin system code and individual plugins
2. **Extension System Validation**: Ensure extensions still work correctly
3. **Import Updates**: Update all internal imports systematically
4. **Compatibility Layer**: Add backward compatibility for external code
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of new structure
6. **Documentation**: Update all documentation and guides

### Post-Migration Tasks

1. **Monitoring**: Monitor for any issues with new structure
2. **Support**: Provide support for external developers migrating
3. **Cleanup**: Gradual removal of compatibility layer
4. **Optimization**: Optimize new structure based on usage patterns

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- All existing functionality continues to work without changes
- New directory structure is logical and easy to navigate
- Import paths are consistent and predictable
- Plugin and extension systems work correctly with new structure

### Developer Experience Success
- Developers can easily find and navigate code
- New developers can quickly understand the organization
- Development tools work correctly with new structure
- Documentation clearly explains the new organization

### Technical Success
- Build and deployment processes work without changes
- Performance is maintained or improved
- Test coverage is maintained
- No breaking changes for external integrations (during compatibility period)

### Migration Success
- Migration completes without data loss or corruption
- Rollback capability is available if needed
- Compatibility layer provides smooth transition
- External developers have clear migration path

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Import Dependencies**: Complex import chains could break
2. **External Integrations**: Third-party code using old imports
3. **Build Processes**: CI/CD pipelines might need updates
4. **Plugin Loading**: Dynamic plugin loading could fail

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive testing before and after migration
2. **Gradual Migration**: Phased approach with validation at each step
3. **Compatibility Layer**: Temporary backward compatibility
4. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert changes if critical issues arise
5. **Communication**: Clear communication to all stakeholders

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to reorganizing the directory structure while minimizing risk and maintaining system stability.
