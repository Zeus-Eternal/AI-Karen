# KIRE Production Readiness Audit

## Executive Summary
- **Overall status:** Kari Intelligent Routing Engine (KIRE) is feature-complete for adaptive provider selection, but several production-critical hardening tasks remain before declaring GA readiness.
- **Strengths:** The router composes caching, deduplication, profile-aware assignments, and warm-up flows with structured logging and Prometheus metrics, aligning with the platform's modular objective.
- **Key risks:** Cache-key collisions, permissive health fallbacks, and the absence of automated validation/testing expose the system to incorrect routing and undetected regressions.

## Architecture & Functionality Review
### Router Core
- `KIRERouter` builds on shared cache utilities and emits metrics for cache hits/misses and latency, while deduplicating concurrent routing decisions; decisions embed profile assignments, analyzer output, and fallback chains for downstream consumers.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/kire_router.py†L10-L169】
- Refinement logic checks provider health, prefers step-specific models, enforces rudimentary cost ceilings, and falls back to degraded mode when health checks fail, supporting progressive enhancement of routing intelligence.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/kire_router.py†L172-L226】
- Cache invalidation helpers and diagnostics expose cache/dedup stats for operations tooling and align with the project mandate for modular observability hooks.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/kire_router.py†L266-L289】

### Profile & Assignment Resolution
- `ProfileResolver` gracefully bridges multiple profile backends (JSON/YAML/config service) to a unified assignment schema, defaulting to sensible providers/models when explicit mappings are absent.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/profile_resolver.py†L15-L140】
- Routing dataclasses keep request/decision metadata explicit, easing serialization across engines and UI layers.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/types.py†L9-L47】

### Integrations & Warm-Up
- Routing actions register KIRE with the predictor system, enforce RBAC on mutating operations, and expose audit/dry-run utilities for operators.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/actions.py†L15-L200】
- Startup routines explicitly import routing actions, perform provider health checks, and attempt proactive cache warm-ups to reduce cold-start latency.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/integrations/startup.py†L21-L138】
- The LLM registry lazily instantiates the KIRE adapter and provides fallback behavior if routing fails, preventing total outages when routing is unavailable.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/integrations/llm_registry.py†L768-L814】

### Observability & Diagnostics
- Decision logging publishes structured OSIRIS-compatible events, pushes to the event bus, and retains a rolling in-memory audit trail for quick inspections.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/decision_logger.py†L30-L130】
- Prometheus-compatible counters/histograms instrument routing decisions, cache usage, and action invocations with safe fallbacks when Prometheus is missing.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/monitoring/kire_metrics.py†L6-L52】
- FastAPI diagnostics endpoints surface cache and deduplication stats behind admin gating, supporting production SRE workflows.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/api_routes/kire_routes.py†L1-L35】

## Production Readiness Risks
1. **Cache key collisions:** `_generate_cache_key` omits the user query and context, so distinct prompts with identical requirements/tasks collide, causing stale or incorrect routing decisions to be served from cache.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/kire_router.py†L242-L247】 Prioritize including the query signature (or hashed intent features) in the key before launch.
2. **Health gate fallback defaults to "healthy":** If the `provider_status` integration fails to import, the fallback `ProviderHealth` class always reports providers as healthy, defeating resilience logic and masking outages.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/kire_router.py†L27-L45】 Production deployment should fail fast or degrade confidence when health instrumentation is unavailable.
3. **Task analysis heuristics are brittle:** Keyword-only detection lacks intent weighting, user/profile context, or model capability scoring, risking misclassification for enterprise workloads (e.g., compliance, multilingual).【F:src/ai_karen_engine/integrations/task_analyzer.py†L22-L78】 Consider augmenting with telemetry-trained models or configurable rules before GA.
4. **No automated test coverage:** Repository tests do not reference KIRE modules, leaving routing logic, RBAC, and cache safety unvalidated in CI.【a486d0†L1-L2】 Add unit/integration suites that exercise routing paths, health fallbacks, and cache invalidation.
5. **RBAC bypass on selection:** `routing.select` lacks explicit RBAC or rate limiting; hostile tenants could brute-force routing metadata. Evaluate auth requirements or throttling consistent with production policies.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/actions.py†L48-L86】

## Operational Gaps & TODOs
- **Cache invalidation strategy:** Provide hooks for provider health webhooks to call `invalidate_provider_cache` so incidents clear stale entries automatically.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/kire_router.py†L266-L279】
- **Metrics enrichment:** Include decision confidence buckets and provider/model labels in metrics to improve production dashboards.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/monitoring/kire_metrics.py†L9-L45】
- **Audit persistence:** Current decision history is in-memory only; persisting to durable storage would support incident forensics and compliance reporting.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/decision_logger.py†L30-L130】

## Alignment with Project Objectives
- KIRE adheres to the modular doctrine by living under `ai_karen_engine.routing`, using absolute imports, and integrating cleanly with registries and startup warm-ups, supporting future package extraction.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/kire_router.py†L10-L289】【F:src/ai_karen_engine/integrations/startup.py†L21-L138】
- Routing actions and diagnostics expose enterprise-ready controls (profiles, health, audit), aligning with the platform goal of operational transparency.【F:src/ai_karen_engine/routing/actions.py†L15-L200】【F:src/ai_karen_engine/api_routes/kire_routes.py†L1-L35】

## Verification Performed
- `python -m compileall src/ai_karen_engine/routing` (ensures syntax integrity across routing modules).【f1976b†L1-L7】

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Patch cache key generation and add targeted regression tests for cache correctness and fallback behavior.
2. Harden provider health integration (fail closed or lower confidence) and add monitoring alerts when Prometheus metrics degrade to dummies.
3. Expand task analysis through configurable classifiers or ML models and capture accuracy metrics before production rollout.
4. Implement CI coverage for routing actions, RBAC guards, and API diagnostics to ensure ongoing compliance with readiness criteria.
