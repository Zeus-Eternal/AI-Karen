# Prompt-Driven Automation Extension

The Prompt-Driven Automation Extension is Kari's flagship automation platform that enables users to create complex workflows using natural language descriptions. This extension represents Kari's answer to traditional automation platforms like N8N, but powered by AI understanding rather than visual workflow builders.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Creating Your First Workflow

1. **Open Automation Studio**: Navigate to the Automation Studio in your Kari interface
2. **Describe Your Workflow**: Use natural language to describe what you want to automate
   ```
   Example: "Monitor our GitHub repo and notify Slack when tests fail"
   ```
3. **Review AI Analysis**: The system will analyze your request and suggest plugins
4. **Create Workflow**: Click "Create Workflow" to generate your automation
5. **Test & Deploy**: Execute the workflow and activate it for production use

### Example Workflows

#### GitHub to Slack Monitoring
```
Prompt: "Monitor our GitHub repository for failed CI builds and send alerts to our #dev-alerts Slack channel"

Generated Workflow:
1. Monitor GitHub repository events
2. Filter for CI/CD pipeline failures
3. Format alert message with build details
4. Send notification to Slack channel
```

#### File Processing Pipeline
```
Prompt: "When new CSV files are uploaded to our data folder, process them and email a summary report"

Generated Workflow:
1. Monitor file system for new CSV files
2. Process and validate CSV data
3. Generate summary statistics
4. Create formatted report
5. Email report to stakeholders
```

#### Web Content Monitoring
```
Prompt: "Check our competitor's pricing page daily and alert us if prices change"

Generated Workflow:
1. Scrape competitor pricing page
2. Compare with previous data
3. Detect price changes
4. Send alert with change details
```
