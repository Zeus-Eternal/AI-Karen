# Authentication Hardening – Production Rollout

## Overview
The temporary "no-auth" simplification has been retired. Kari AI now ships with the hardened
`ProductionAuthService`, re-enabling full credential checks, JWT issuance, rate limiting, and
first-run admin bootstrap flows.

## Key Updates

### 1. Authentication Service (`src/auth/auth_service.py`)
- ✅ Wraps `ProductionAuthService` with a shared async singleton.
- ✅ Exposes both async (`await get_auth_service()`) and sync (`get_auth_service_sync()`) accessors.
- ✅ Provides an `AuthService` façade for legacy integrations (extensions, scripts).
- ✅ Normalises `UserAccount` payloads for API consumers without leaking password hashes.

### 2. Authentication Middleware (`src/auth/auth_middleware.py`)
- ✅ Enforces Bearer token or signed session cookie authentication.
- ✅ Marks pre-flight `OPTIONS` requests and public routes as pass-through.
- ✅ Blocks unverified accounts and ensures admin-only routes honour RBAC expectations.

### 3. API Routes (`src/auth/auth_routes.py`)
- ✅ Re-export the production FastAPI router (`ai_karen_engine.api_routes.production_auth_routes`).
- ✅ Startup hooks now initialise the production auth engine so health endpoints reflect real state.

### 4. Tooling & Diagnostics
- ✅ `tests/manual/test_auth_debug.py` now initialises the production service via `get_auth_service_sync()`.
- ✅ `scripts/auth_system_status.py` validates the production router/middleware imports and guides operators to production checks.

## Operational Notes
- Credentials are persisted in `data/users.json`. The first run flow seeds an administrator when required.
- JWT settings honour `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, token expirations, and brute force lock-outs.
- Email verification is enforced at middleware level – unverified accounts cannot access privileged routes until confirmed.

## Migration Guidance
- Update any ad-hoc tooling to import from `src.auth` rather than the retired simple modules.
- Ensure frontend `.env` files point to the production API (e.g. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`).
- Rotate the JWT secret (`JWT_SECRET_KEY`) before public deployment.

## Follow-up
- Run `python scripts/auth_system_status.py` to confirm the hardened stack is active.
- Execute the Playwright login E2E suite to validate the UI against real authentication flows.
