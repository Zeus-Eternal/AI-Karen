# AG-UI Memory Interface Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented Task 8 by exposing the existing memory system through a new AG-UI interface. The implementation provides AG-UI specific models, transformation utilities, and an API endpoint for querying memories.

## Key Changes
- Added AG-UI Pydantic models: `AGUIMemoryQuery`, `AGUIMemoryEntry`, and `AGUIMemoryQueryResponse`.
- Implemented compatibility helpers to convert AG-UI requests and responses to internal formats.
- Created `/api/agui/memory/query` route for AG-UI memory queries.
- Added unit tests covering query and response transformations.

## Testing
- `tests/test_ag_ui_memory_interface.py`
